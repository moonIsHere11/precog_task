Since the 1950's everyone's dream was to have a nice car but it is coming to a point in time where the car culture is coming to an end. You might be thinking that this is horrible and how will i get places without a car. No, it's not horrible at all, it's actually very beneficial in other ways. It can help people become free,less dependent,and it reduces the amount of greenhouse gases tremendously.

The first reason that limiting car use is a good thing is because it can help people become free and less dependent. It has caused people to not always be in a hurry and made them less stressed. In Bogota, Colombia they had a carfree day where people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. People felt so free and they felt they were doing a good deed so some got rid of their cars for good. Cars are becoming less popular in the world as we speak. For example from 2005 to 2013 the number of miles driven in the U.S.has reduced by 9%, which is equal to where the country was in 1995. Another example is that a study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. Also shopping centers are moving to places where they can be walked to rather than on a way off highway somewhere."What intrigues me is that rates ofcar ownership per household and per person has started to come down two to three years before the downturn," says Micheal siva who studies this trend at the University of Michigan.

The next reason is that increasing the use of cars will help the environment greatly. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe and 50% in the U.S. All of our development since World War 2 has been centered around cars and it hasn't helped the environment any. For example, in Paris they were going to have two no car days to reduce the smog. The first day they said that no one with and even numbered license plate were allowed to drive and odd would be the next. After the first day was over the smog was reduced by so much that they didn't even have to use the next day. This is just a small number of people. Imagine if everyone would participate even just for small periods of time.

In conclusion, now that you have learned that life without out cars can make you feel free, less dependent, and have the environment. Have you changed your opinion? "giving up cars is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twosear bicycle with his wife.

Now a days you see everyone with cars driving to places instead of walking. There are some small towns that cars are not needed because everything is so close but other cities everyone has to drive because everything is very distant from one another. Cars are needed on a daily basis to get to school, or to get to their job but walking or even biking would be a great idea because you would not be poluting the environment there would be less traffic jams and it would reduce the greenhouse gas. Limiting car usage would be a great idea and it would make peoples life a lot better and healthier because instead of driving they would walk to take a bike.

Polution is a big problem especially in big cities because everyone is driving and the smoke the cars leave makes our environment gross. Polution is not only because of the smoke the cars produce, it can also be when someone throws plastic into the oceans and poluting the waters or having trash in parks without recycling. I think we should reenforce the recycling systems because many people dont know the benefits to that and how better our community and even world could be. When your are driving a car and especially in big cities like New York you need a car everywhere or just take the taxi. But just taking the taxi it wont reduce the probablity of polluting the air, it will still have the same effect as if you were driving your own car. If people would just walk or bike to their job or to their school poluting the air would not be a problem just like stated in source 2. In source 2 it talks about how in Paris they would fine the people up to 31 dollars.

There would also be less traffic jams due to the limiting of car usage just like stated in Source 3. In source 3 it talks about how in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that the colombians would ride their bike skate or take the bus and there would be less traffic jams. That is a very good idea because no one likes to be stuck in traffic especially if your in a hurry to get to work or even school. Traffic jams occur because of so many cars on the road. There is a thing called Rush hour and that is when everyone is leaving their work or school and they are going home and that is when everyone is on the road and thats when their is the most traffic. But it would be much easier if you would just bike or walk or take a bus and tried to avoid all of those traffic jams. The program that Bogota, Colombia has created is something that should be done nationwide because it would help so many other countries. Thanks to that programm people would go to the park and do sports and take walks.

Source A talks about the Greenhouse gas and how in Vauban,Germany soccer moms gave up their cars and how the streets were " Car Free". That led to having 70 percent of the families in Vauban to not having cars and 57 percent of the people that moved to Vauban to sell their cars. According to this source a person said they are much happier not owning or having a car because when Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother had a car she said she was more tense. Apperently this movement was called " Smart Planning".

Limiting car usage would be a great benefit to people and a great idea to improve Earth. Pollution like mentioned before is one of the biggest problems we have and in big cities is an evern bigger problem. Traffic jams is something that will be hard to stop because everyone is using cars and will continue to use cars because it seems like thats the fastest way to get to your location but thats not accurate because if people think that way then thats the cause of traffic jams and thats the cause of the Rush hour. The movement in Vauban, Germany is something that people should do. Im not saying sell your car but to reduce the car usage is something that would be very helpful not only to you, but for the environment.

The promise of reduced traffic accidents and fatalities has positioned self-driving cars as a potential revolution in transportation safety.

Beyond safety, self-driving cars have the potential to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance overall transportation efficiency. Automated systems can communicate with each other to optimize routes, minimize delays, and mitigate the environmental impact of transportation. However, the widespread adoption of self-driving cars raises concerns about job displacement in the transportation industry.

The societal implications of self-driving cars extend to urban planning, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks. Cities may need to adapt to the changing dynamics of transportation, considering factors such as parking requirements, traffic patterns, and public transit integration. Ethical considerations, such as decision-making algorithms in emergency situations, also pose challenges that require careful consideration.

In conclusion, the advent of self-driving cars represents a potential transformation in transportation with implications for safety, efficiency, and societal dynamics. As technology progresses, addressing ethical, regulatory, and societal considerations will be essential to ensure a responsible and beneficial integration of autonomous vehicles into our daily lives."

Cars are a huge advantage in traveling. They can get people to places faster than a single horse could and their a lot safer than riding on a horse. While there are positive advantages to these moble transportation, there are also negative portions that cars have. You may be awfully surprised what these transports can do outside their good nature. For instance, cars run on fossil fuel, which is a artificial gas that ruins the environment as much as people cutting down trees and smoke coming out of nuclear plants that do damage to the clouds in the sky. Cars don't just hurt the environment, they hurt innocent lives as well. Let me pull out an example: Person A and Person C are driving on the interstate when Person B spills out too much fossil fuel from the exhaust pipe of his car. This causes both Person A & C to spin out of control and crash into each other because they couldn't see the road very well because of Person B. This isn't the only threat cars can pull into, but I'll get to that later. With all these bad occurrences that happen people have been wondering, "how can we save both lives and the environment from the issues of cars at the same time"? There is a way to do just that: limiting car usage.

Like I said before, cars can have a lot of negative issues in their state of mind. Some examples are foggy weather, over usage of fossil fuel, speeding, texting and driving, drunk driving and many more that exist that I cannot mention. Because of these issues, cities like Vauban Germany, Paris France and Bogota Colombia have bannedwell not really banned but you get what i mean driving cars due to the bad issues cars canhave caused. In the US, the presentage of people driving cars has decreased a lot over the past few years the story doesn't say what persentage. As much as I hate them doing that, they actually have a reason. In this case of fellow citizens, car usage should be banned for various reasons. I won't be telling all the reasons because that would take a long time to do so.

Reason 1: Drunk driving. Have you ever known someone or heard about an incident were a person is drunk inside a car and crashes into any random source they don't see coming? Well, let us face the facts: drunk people should not drive. If someone is drunk at a bar and is feeling funny, they should either walk home or get someone to pick them up. Drunk people who drive have a great chance at getting someone hurt of themselves hurt because of their stupid attitude. The person shouldn't drive again until they are fully consious again. Reason 2: Extreme weather. When people drive in extreme, they are risking their lives in a greater persentage than a zombie apocolypse, terrorists invading any country and being attacked by people who try to kill you. Extreme weather like thunderstorms, hail and strong fog are too dangerous for people to drive in. If you drive in that type of weather, there is a 90% chance you will not make it out without injuries. People need to wait for the weather to either calm down or stop completelyI just wait until it stops completely so that it wouldn't get worse as it calms down. This will help them prevent them or anyone from getting a wreck. If it occurs randomly while your driving then your screwed. Reason 3: texting and driving. Why is it that most people in this generation keep getting stupid and stupid every single minute? This is one of those incidents that has such that. People who text while driving pay more attention to their stupid phone than focusing on driving. Like drunk driving people who care about texting so much need to either sit in the back and text or not ride in the car at all. They propably should stay away from a car as long as possible until they learn to not text and drive at the same time. You can't do two things at once unless you're some one fictional or a pro at it. Final reason: Expoit of fossil fuels. I don't need to talk much about this one because I already did in my first paragraph and it is related to the extreme weather topic but I will do it once more. Cars that exploit fossil fuels can cause damage to the environment. If the smoke is exploited too much it can not only more damage to the environment, but it can cause people to reck as well.

These are the reasons that fellow citizens like you should limit your car usages. Remember that cars are not a same transportation vehicle that can get you from point A to Point B, they have a dark side like everything else. Even if you do limit your car usages, it doesn't mean you are safe from the world that hunts you down. Be careful out there and follow the percautions of safty carefully when you are traveling either by car or anyother place.

The electoral college is one of the most heavily criticized institutions in the American government system. It has been considered outdated and antidemocratic. However, without it, the balance of power in America would be skewed to an unacceptable degree. States with large populations would be disproportionately empowered, without the electoral college. This leaves the smaller states existence to be controlled by the larger states, to the dismay of the American economy and people.

As it stands, most states vote in a way that presents a united front of electors to the electoral college. If just over half of the Californian voters vote for one candidate that they think would represent their interests, the map in source 3 shows that all 55 electors will present their votes to the college. It is better for California to be represented in this way so that the Californian economy would not be adversely effected by their minority voters. That sort of united front is beneficial to every state in the union, for the same reason.

The argument that the electoral college discourages voters of the minority party to vote is a valid criticism, but it is a problem that can be solved without the loss of the electoral college. Compulsory voting would be far more effective if voter turnout is an issue. People who would not have voted otherwise would still likely vote for the candidate they supported if voting was made mandatory.

In source 2, Bradford Plumer expressed dissatisfaction with the way political campaigns involving the electoral college focus on swing states rather than allowing equal debate in all states, but that does not make for a less desirable outcome. Dissolving the electoral college would make swing states irrelevant to presidential elections, as it'd be impossible to win votes in those states by any decent margin. Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed.

The electoral college might not be the best potential method for presidential elections. It is, however, far more desirable for such a large country than popular vote. Popular vote would lead to neglecting many areas of the economy that are important, but do not have a presence in states with large populations. It would make elections more one sided for each state at the same time. The problems the opponents say abolishing it would fix, would be fixed without it, but doing so would create far more problems than it solved. It is also easy enough to fix the same problems without abolishing the electoral college.

Many people are in belief of evaporating the idea of having the Electoral college. A Gallop poll taken in 2000 shows that citizens would rather have a direct election. As a member of the United States you must think of all the possibilities. Yes, the electoral college was once a great process, but now there are some changes are in need of being made.

The electoral college is a process in which we select electors. This long and dragged out procedure is many steps that take months to prepare for. First, there must be a selection of the electors which are chosen by the states. Then the meeting must be planned and taken place. Who and why is a hard aspect to decide on voting day for those who have been chosen to be the electors. Votes for president and Vice President must be made. After voting the counting beings. The Electoral College has a total of 538 members. Over 270 votes must be made to elect the President. This process can easily be shortened by using a direct election.

By having a direct election everyone's voice is heard. This means less arguing in the states. Citizens enjoying believing their thoughts are not being avoided. Having the Electoral College taking place is highly unwanted in the US. This is because the people believe a direct vote is more efficient way for them to show who they believe is worthy of being President and Vice President.

Each candidate running for office retains a group of electors from a state. These electors are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. This means if a person doesn like the electors chosen they feel like they still dont have a say of what is going on in the presidential election.

In conclusion, The Electoral College is no longer a process citizens enjoy. This procedure is too long and citizens dont encourage it. Many people believe that this branch of government feels they will lose more power if the Electoral College is given up on. Using a direct election will spare the arguments and will allow us to have an easy and manageable process in which to vote on our leading man.

Deaor Mor. Senatoor, What is the Electooral College? Can voteors contorol whom theior electoors vote foor? Not always. The Electooral College is an unfaior, outdated, and iororational porocess. Although many believe it is a necessity foor choosing a poresident, it is not. I believe the porocess of choosing a poresident should be changed to the election by populaor vote in the United States.

Fiorst, what is the Electooral College? In the passage "What Is the Electooral College" it says, "It is a porocess by which the founding fatheors established in the Constitution as a comporomise between election of the Poresident by a vote in Congoress and election of the Poresident by a populaor vote of qualified citizens. The poresidential election is held eveory fouor yeaors on the Tuesday afteor the fiorst Monday in Novembeor. You help choose youor state's electoors when you vote foor youor Poresident because when you vote foor youor candidate you aore actually voting foor youor candidates electoors." But, little did the fouding fatheors know it is not oreally a comporomise. The Electooral College is composed of 538 electoors.Some of them unfaior ones too. A majoority of 270 electooral votes is orequiored to elect the Poresident. In souorce 2 it says, "The poresidential election is held eveory fouor yeaors on the Tuesday afteor the fiorst Monday in Novembeor. You help choose youor state's electoors when you vote foor youor Poresident because when you vote foor you or candidate you aore actually voting foor youor candidates electoors." Second, the Electooral College is not a place, it is a porocess, an unfaior, outdated, and iororational porocess. Accoording to the passage "The Indefensible Electooral College" it states how, "Undeor the Electooral College system, voteors vote not foor the poresident, but foor a slate of electoors who in tuorn elect the poresident." Do you think that is faior? This porocess is confusing and it should be abolished. Due to the Electooral College many people get confused and sometimes vote foor the worong candidate. In the souorce "The Indefensible Electooral College" it says, " faithless electoors have occasionally orefused to vote foor theior paorty's candidate and cast a deciding vote foor whomeveor they please." That is unfaior, and iororational. People should be able to have a choice, although they let you feel like you'ore doing something by voting, you actually aore not doing much. The Electooral College gets the last woord.

Thiord, some aorgue that the Electooral College has good intentions, they suppoort theior claims with ideas stated in the passage "In Defense of the Electooral College" some such as "The Electooral College orestoores some of the weight in the political balance to laorge states, the Electooral College orequiores a poresidential candidate to have toransoregional appeal, oor the Electooral College avoids the poroblem of elections in which no candidate orecieves a majoority of the votes cast." Although these oreasons may be valid, they'ore not enough to puorsuade thousands of U.S citizens that the Electooral College should not be abolished.

Cat got youor tongue? In conclusion, as you can see the Electooral College is not always the best way to choose a poresident, it is unfaior, it is outdated since the founding fatheors had set it up, and it is iororational. the Electooral College should be oreplaced with the porocess of populaor vote.

Dear state senator, Many people believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, while others believe that the Electoral College should stay as it is. However, what most people who want to keep the electoral college, do not know is that when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Which means that the people do not get a direct vote towards the president. Therefore, it can cause disinterest in people who are eligible to vote. That is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

The first reason as to why I favor in abolishing the Electoral college is because you can not always trust the electors. As shown back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. Also, due to the winnertakeall system, candidates do not spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, it is obvious that they just want to win and you can not trust those candidates, especially the people who promise to do things they know they can not fulfill. The electors that "the people vote for" do not want to help their state, they do not even care for the needs of the people, they are just there for the money. Another reason as to why you can not trust the electors is because it is known that the electors can vote for whomever they choose and forget about the people's needs. One of the main reasons as to why this causes disinterest in potential voters. If the people vote directly for the president they have a better chance in speaking up and fighting for what they want therefore, trusting. Those are some of the rights that are taken away by the electoral college and people do not even realize it.

Another reason as to why I believe the electoral college should be abolished is because the electoral college is unfair to voters. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half of the people! If the government really cared for what the people want, the electoral college would have been abolished by now. Studies have shown that only half of the people living in the U.S have voted in the pasts elections. If you really want the number of voters to increase and for citizens of the U.S to express their political preferences you should actually listen to them and abolish the electoral college.

Lastly, the electoral college prevents voters from controling who they vote for. Many voters now in days believe that when they vote, their one vote decides the election but, they are wrong. If they abolish the electoral college the voters would have a better chance in having who they want for president. The people who vote in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference we'll have more citizens voting if the electoral college is abolished. How do you expect for U.

Dear or or Ms Senator, Presient Richard Nixon, and President Bill Clinton both have something in common they won their residencies with the Electoral College, not the popular vote. According to "In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. Paragraph 22 Richard and Bill only won 43% of the popular vote against their opponents while they were running for office. This is why the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of switching to the popular vote for the elections.

Now you're probably wondering, does high school students even know what the Electoral College is and what it's job? Yes, high school students do know what the Electoral College is and what it does. The Electoral College is made up of 538 electors. Your state amount equals one member from the House of representatives and two from the Senate. The electors are chosen from the candidate's political party. The Electoral College decides the president and vice president every four years every Tuesday ater the first Monday in the month of November.

or or Ms Senator, the Electoral College needs to stay instead of the popular vote because when you have the Electoral College you will get an outcome from it unlike the popular vote. Almost all states have the "winners take all" method which according to "What is te Electoral College" by the Office of the Federal register Paragraph 7 this method is when all electors are awarded to the presidential candidate that is winning. Also the popular vote overrides the popular vote. In "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner paragraph 18 the 2012 presidential campaign for example it was the battle between Mitt rodney who is a Republican against Barack Obama who is a Democrat. Obama received only 51.3 percent of the popular vote and Obama got 61.7 percent of the Electoral College. As you can see the Electoral College overrided the popular vote which ultimately made him president. Also in "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden" Paragraph 22take Richard Nixon's and Bill Clinton's presidential campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn't have become President of the United States.

To continue on, the Electoral College should stay instead of the popular vote since one region of the United States doesn't have enough power of the Electoral Votes to make a presidential candidate win. Look at "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" Mitt rodney doesn't campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn't bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidential candidates have to say since they are tossup states. These swing states literally can "swing" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidential canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen.

On the other hand, according to "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong" Parargraph 14 the Electoral is outdated, irrational, and unfair. In "The Inefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer key names such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, AFLCIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerece all want to get rid of the Electoral College and use the Popular Vote. Look at the presidency that was in 2000 with Al Gore against George W. Bush. Al Gore would have won the election if the election was based on the popular vote. He won the popular vote with over 60%! But unfortunately, he didn't win and lost to George W. Bush since Bush won the Electoral College votes. But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the "winners take all method" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.

Ultimately, or or Ms Senator, the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of the popular vote because you will always have an outcome and one region can't overpower another and make a candidate win the presidential campaign. Yes, as said before many people want to get rid of the Electoral College but it will stay with the United States and move forward with us people.

The automobile has been a staple in human history ever since it was first created, they have been used by people wether it was grocery shopping or during war. These days limiting car use has more advantages than ever. Such advantages are that it helps reduce the amount of pollution to the environment, helps people save money, swell as it helps people become more sociable and less stressed.

The limiting of car usage has many advantages one would be that it helps to reduce pollution caused by fuel emissions. Using vehicles creates green house emissions which cause the Earth to become hotter and then global warming becomes a big problem. According to the article "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." by Elisabeth Rosenthal "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive area in the United States. So limiting car usage reduces the amount of emissions produced greatly. Smog is also a great threat to the environment, smog is created just like fog except polluted air gets into the mix of warm days and cold nights. Then instead of getting fog there is smog a more dense unhealthy version of fog. Paris has had a rough time when it came to smog which according to "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer resulted from the fact that "Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France.

Saving money is a big plus to the restriction on car use. With more buildings and shopping centers being built closer to suburban area makes walking a good way to save money. Andrew Selsky author of the article "carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" made a comment on the situation in Bogota saying "parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up". With more shopping centers for people to be able to reach by foot, bike, carpool, or bus can greatly reduce the amount people spend on gas and car repairs.

Limiting the usage of cars also in a strange way helps people become more connected with each other. Limiting car use will alow people to hang out more in things such as carpooling, bike rides, walking, public transportation. Allowing for people to meet more people. Also it wil allow people to use things such as social media to stil feel connected to their freinds without having to drive out to meet them. In another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal "The End of Car Culture" Rosenthal interviewed professor Mimi Sheller Who stated "the rise iin cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arranments,includiong the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. The restriction on car usage allows for people to meet new people through the carpool service and such things.

A limitaion on car usage would have so many advntages to people and the environment. It helps reduce the amount of pollution from fuel and carbon emissions, helps people save money and not need a car to get to a store or park, and have people become more connected to each other.

Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potentially become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go "down 60 percent... after fivedays of intensifying smog." This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. additionally, limiting car usage can push more people into exercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians "hiked, biked, skated..." during their carfree days source 3. Also, many "parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city" source 3. With an increase of exercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.

furthermore, lowering car usage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a carowner may "buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home source 1." Normally, a decent size house is approximately 100,000 to 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said "I'm much happier this way source 1," because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stressfree lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.

The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow.

As an American citizen, I am aware that cars are a big form of transportation. For me that is my way of getting everywhere. But I never really thought about the consequences of driving a car or even that there may be advantages to not driving one. Other countries have realized that their are advantages and are working on promoting citizens to use other types of transportation. Through out the world many countries are pushing for "carfree" areas and eventually "carfree" countries. Many of these countries are trying different strategies to accomplish this goal. Some examples would be Paris, where they only permit certain cars to drive each day depending on their license plate number, as found in source 2, parts of Germany are creating "carfree" communities and if you want to have a car you must pay 40,000 dollars in order to park in a parking garage in the front of the community, according to source 1, even Cities in Colombia promote what they call a Day Without Cars, as said in source 3. Even though here in the United States we haven't enforced any laws against driving, some citizens are choosing to not to drive. These countries are creating these new lifestyles in order to prevent air pollution, take away the stress of driving on the roads, and to bring the communities closer together.

As many people may already know, cars release greenhouse gasses that are harmful to our environment. As said in source 1, "Passenger cars are responsible for up to 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions into the environment." Parts of Germany are working to solve this issue by creating "carfree" communities. Some of these communities house up to 5500 residents. This change is getting a positive reaction, with more people moving into these communities than predicted. This is a movement called "smart planning" which is a trend that is growing and spreading into many parts of Europe, some parts of the United States and elsewhere.

Paris however is trying a different strategy that doesnt require people moving into completely new areas. They are now enforcing laws permitting certain cars to drive on their designated days. For example, on Mondays drivers who's cars have evennumbered license plates must leave their cars at home and find a different form of transportation for that day or else they will be fined 22euros31. So far 4,000 drivers have been fined. Paris's goal is also to cut down the emission of harmful gasses into the environment but mainly trying to reduce smog. Since deisel fuel is a large contributor and the majority of the vehicles in Paris run on diesel fuel they are cutting down the number days you are allowed to drive.

Colombia is also using Paris' strategy, but their "carfree" days are limited to once every year. Colombia has been using this stategy for 3 years and each year getting a better turnout of people participating. Violators who choose to drive on this day known as the Day Without Cars day, are fined 25. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation, interaction between citizens, limit individuals stress levels, and reduce smog. Heidrun Walter, a citizen in Colombia quoted, "When I drive my car I'm always tense. I'm much happier when I'm not behind the wheel." Haidrun is just one of many citizens who have expressed their interest in this new method.

After looking at the consequences of driving a car, and seeing the multiple advantages of not having one has changed my perspective on things. I know the feeling of being stressed when driving and I've always thought, if I could I would choose a different form of transportation. After seeing other countries promoting their citizens to choose alternative forms of transportation, I now hope the United States will enforce something similar. Not only do you help the environment but it is safer for yourself and everyone around you. Living a lifestyle with no air pollution, stress, or traffic jams will be safer and more efficient. Hopefully every other citizens perspective on this will change, if it hasn't already. I'm lookinf forward to seeing you walking next to me on the sidewalk.

Cars most people use them for transportation. It's our lazy way of getting to places.

Automobiles benefit us plenty when it comes to getting from point A to point B, but they also have a big negative impact. Cars are responsible for a huge amount of pollution like greenhouse gas emissions and smog. If we were to limit car usage, we could decrease the amount of stress and pollution emitted into the air, as well as give our community a chance to improve.

In Vauban, Germany, residents have given up their cars and have no problem doing so. Cars are generally not allowed, forbidden some would say, in this district. vaughn's streets are pretty much "carfree". Of course car ownership is still allowed, with the exception that you have to be able to find a place to park since there are only two places large garages at the end of the development, where a carowner can buy a space for 40,000, along with a home. "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way," Heidrun Walter stated, a mother of two. Experts say automobiles are a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Paris participated in a driving ban, which violators suffered a fine of 22euro31. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, for example, last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter while Brussels had 114 PM and 79.7 PM in London. Since Paris participated in this ban, 60 percent of Paris' smog has cleared.

In Bogota, Columbia, the city held a carfree day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third year in a row cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted to this Day Without Cars. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog as well. Violators here faced 25 fines. Even with occasional bad weather, people still participated in this event. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man, as he rode a twoseated bicycle with his wife. The Day Without Cars allowed parks and sports centers to bloom, uneven sidewalks to be replaced wih broad smooth sidewalks, new restaurants and upscale shopping districs to crop up, and rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

In the United States, Americans are starting to buy fewer cars, drive less, and get fewer licenses as each year passes partially because cashstrapped Americans couldn't afford new cars. If this pattern continues, which many sociologists believe, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment. Even though reducing automobile transportation could have negative implications for car industries, the positive affects are much more important. In this generation, the internet allows people to connect without having to drive to meet friends. At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which "pedesrtian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety." In conclusion, cars are starting to be less and less of a neccesity, and more and more people are starting to notice that automobiles are just hurting the enviornment. By limiting car use, it can limit stress, help the enviornment as well as communities to improve, save time, conserve resources and improvee safety. There are plenty of other ways to get transportation that are less damaging and dangerous, like bicycles and walking. Of course it may take a little longer to get places without a car, but you can always ride a bus, or enjoy the scenery while riding a bike or walking.

Dear, Mr.Mrs. Florida state senator I am writing to you about the Electoral College and i would like to share my opions with you. As we know the Electoral College chooses the president by having 538 electors and the winning president must have at least 270 electoral votes to claim the presidency. States get a number of electoral voters and depending on the size of the state depends how many voters that state gets, bigger states get more electoral voters and smaller states for example Rhode Island get less. The way the Electoral College is set up it seems that the menwomen running for presidency would try to get the minds of the bigger states with more electoral voters to choose them so they can reach the 270 mark. It is clear to me that we have done it this way ever since the founding fathers created it. Its time for a change, the Electoral College is out of date and needs to be replaced with popular vote. Lets not forget the 2000 election when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost because of the Electoral College, Al Gore quite frankly should have won, I mean he did have more votes.

The Electoral College is a system that doesn work, popular vote on the other hand does work. If the United States of America wants a "fair" election then we should give them one with the popular vote. It is simple and easy to understand, the madwoman with the most votes wins the presidency. Its time to let the Electoral College go byebye, the 538 electoral voters need to leave and make room for a more efficient election. Most Americans are done with the "winnertakeall" style, if we can let the Electoral College go we can have more "fair" elections, not "winnertakeall" elections. Sometimes though even the electoral voters don't even vote for who won that state they also vote for whom they want to be president. The Electoral College is not efficient, in "1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election," and again in 1976 a tie could have happened if some voters voted the other way, in that case they were only a few votes away from a disaster. If we have the popular vote then candidates would try to get everyone from every state, but with the Electoral College some candidates dont even visit a state or a region they know they won't win over. So that means they will try the bigger states or a region they came from with that said its unfair to the voters.

The Electoral College is a good way for the voters within the college to cheat their way into having the candiate they want to win, win. So if this country wants a more fair vote every four years on a Tuesday after the first Monday then we must have popular vote.

I hope you will take my facts and opions into consideration and give it time to think and discuss what you think, but if everyone wants a more fair election I say we give them one.

Thank you for your time, from: a student from a high school.

Many places such as Vauban, Germany have given up the usage of cars. Vauban is a goring trend in europe and the United states because of the positive effects of not using cars. One of the biggest examples is polution, also the removal of cars would ultimately lead to a financial increase in our economy, lastly making this change positively effects our future.

First I would like to talk about a huge problem we face as a society today and that is green house gasses. You may not think that these are a big deal put if left unchecked they can become a huge problem. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas. This can become a huge problem ranging from acid rain to climate change. An example of what polution can do to a city is in paris they are putting a partial ban on cars because of how how bad there polution is. There was a huge smog problem because green house gasses were being trapped because of hot days and cold nights.

Also this change can have amazing effects on that areas economy. Because there will be no cars people will take the bus witch is less than paying for gas or they can walk to closer places. Also gas prices would decrease for other forms of transportation because there wouldnt be cars demanding the fuel. family could sell there cars and spend the money they were using to fund there car other thing witch will lead to the people being happier. Also the removal of cars will lead to the creation of jobs because they will need people to operate public transportation.

Lastly the removal of cars will have a positive effect on the future of our world. With the track were on now the world is estimated to heat up and have negative consequences on our society. these climate changes may seem small but they can have drastic effects. in china there is a lake that is so polluted you set the top of it on fire because there is so much pollutants on it. also this chang has coralation with peoples happiness. Were already started down the path of less cars, recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

For the following benefits is why we should stop using cars and continue with the idea of using public tranportation and walking. Cars creat polution, its better for our economy to stop the use of cars and this will poitivley effect out furute.

Greetings Mr. State Senator, Looking over the Electoral College, there has come to be a few interesting details. Yes, the process is beautifully thought out but as we look at it deeper it has its flaws. The founding fathers have given us the Electoral College, which anarchist are very unappreciative veiwing it as a nondemocratic way to vote.

If the Electoral College system goes, then Americans can have their full Constitutional rights. Using this process voters are not voting for the electors of their choice, voters are voting on higher qualified voters to vote for the electors. The whole process is a violator of the amendment entitled to voting. Having this maze of voting for voters, what if a voter confuses of who the electors is voting for so their vote isint actually going to the candidate of their choice. In 1960 before the election of John F. Kennedy, the segregationists of the Louisiana legislator came very close to replacing all of the Democratic electorss with electorss who opposed John F. Kennedy. So all the voters in favor of JFK. will be voting against him and all the Electoral College votes would be going to the other candidate.

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defences are wrong , "At the most basic level, the electorsal college is unfair to voters." Plumer makes a very valid point beacuse of the size of states. The electorsal College's number of representatives are as big as their states population. So if all of the representatives in Alaska vote on the Republican candidate, and most of the people in California vote for the Democratic candidate, the Electoral College vote in California overules the vote in Alaska.

The Electoral College can make some voters not want to vote, usually because of their state size their vote doesnt count as much. Many voters in larger states refuse to vote because their vote wont really change the Electoral Collage's vote. The voters don't have total control over an electors, so the whole election crisis could happen again.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may have worked when the colonies were small and the votes counted, but today the modern society doesnt appreciate its lack of Constitutional rights. All we ask is for our right to vote to be given to us, so we can take part in our government.

Dear Senator, Keeping the electoral college would be a disaster just waiting to happen. It is old, outdated and irrational. Are we really going to keep using the same, old method that our founding fathers used hundreds of years ago? The method itself is unfair to many American voters. It is also unjust to the candidates who won the popularity vote, but not the electoral vote.

The candidates running for presidency usually focus on the bigger states with more electoral votes or "swing" states. This makes the voters in smaller states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina feel like their opinions and voices do not matter, that the president will not care for their interests. Having the electoral college gone, means that the winnertakeall system will also be gone, and will insure voters that the candidates will spend more time in their states trying to win their votes as an individual and not as a whole.

In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gone received more individual votes than George W. Bush, but lost the presidency, because he did not receive the majority of the electoral votes. This is unfair to the candidate, knowing that you won majority of the populations votes, but lost the presidency. In an article called " The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong" Mother Jones stated that after the 2000 presidential race, a poll was taken, over sixty percent of voters would prefer a more direct election than the one we have now.

In another article "In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President", they argue as to why we should keep the electoral college. The author of the article, Richard A. Posner, said that there is a certainty of outcome, that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. That being said, it shows that the voters' vote do not really matter, because it all comes down to the electoral votes.

Despite the numerous amount of people who disagree with the Electoral College and all the agruements against it, we still keep it. Why? What is so bad about getting rid of the Electoral College? It gives a sense to the voters, that they matter and what they say can determine the fate of who is president.

Dear State Senate, The Electoral College is insane. There should not be an Electoral College, the vote should be by popular vote for the presidents. People feel less important when they know that there vote does not go to the entire 538 votes. If you are in a democratic state, like Texas, but are republican, then your vote is not going to matter because the votes are just going to go to the democratic president. When looking back in 2000, Gore had more popular votes, yet he lost the election because of the Electoral College. Thats insane that he lost, because more people wanted him to be presidents, yet that is not how the Electoral College works.

With the swing states, they can really hurt one of the presidents. Lets say Florida, for example, is very close in which president is going to be voted for. That is 29 votes just from that state! If you eliminate the Electoral College, it will be more balanced and that will not make or break one of the presidents. The presidents do not bother with the states that they know they are going to lose, and they do not even visit those states. If we eliminate the Electoral College, then everyone will get to hear from the presidents, and that could give them several extra thousand votes.

Also, the less populated states, like Wisconsin with only 3 votes, feel like they are not important toward the overall votes. If there was no Electoral College, then there 500,000 votes would be a huge boost toward either president. When voting for president, the voters do not even vote for the president! They vote for the state of electors who vote for the president. Who knows if the electors will lie and represent the Democrats or Republicans and then vote for the other side.

Finally, I leave you with my last reason of why we should get rid of the Electoral College. More people in the United States want a popular vote instead. Even Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole think we should. 60% of the United States would prefer a direct election!!! That is a direct message to you that we need to get rid of the Electoral College and start using a popular vote!

I hope you consider these changes to the voting system, as I have listed some of the best reasons. The majority of the country would like to see these changes take affect, not just me. I appreciate the consideration, thank you.

Congestion, the amount of car traffic in a specific area, is significantly decreasing due to a new idea that has sprung:limiting car usage. Places such as Vauban, Paris, Bogota, Cali and Valledupar are participating in a program that's made to decrease car usage. Some of these cities enjoy Day Without Cars, a holiday that "promotes alternative transportation and reduces smog". Selsky 1 Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Limiting car usage promotes a healthier, cleaner environment for all. By using alternative transportation, such as buses, taxis, biking or even walking, the amount of greenhouse emission is drastically reduced. Rosenthal 1 The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States are encouraging "car reduced" communities, causing legislators to act. This will cut the amount of money spent yearly by U.S. citizens and the government as a whole, reducing the federal transportation bill. Rosenthal 1 Paris, too, momentarily banned driving due to smog. Paris enforced a driving ban that lasted a few days to clear the city's air after a close call to record pollution. Although some people were upset, congestion was down 60 percent, and the smog cleared a few days later. Duffer 1 All in all, diesel usage decreased, leaving a "greener" environment in its place.

President Obama has also wanted "to curb the United states greenhouse gas emissions," Rosenthal 1, he revealed last week. Although the United states rate of car ownership per person and per household has started to decrease, there are still more things that could be done to create a longterm cultural shift. Rosenthal 1 New York has recently created a bikesharing program that has done remarkably well. Many cities have proposed plans to make personal vehicle ownership impractical or undesirable. Rosenthal 1 Even Bill Ford, the owner of the Ford Car Company, suggested an idea to creat cities in which "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety," at the Mobile World Congress last year. Rosenthal 1 Bogota, Colombia specifically enjoys a yearly carfree day in which the only exception of vehicle transportation are buses and taxis. This prevents traffic jams, reduces air pollution, and cuts the many costs to cars. Even in rain, the event continued on "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Antanas Mockus, the Bogota Mayor. Selsky 1 Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asucnion, Paraguay, said that "these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders." Smog reduction, costcutting, stressrelieving and trafficjamfree, participating in this global change is an opportunity you won't want to miss.

Dear Senator Nelson, In recent years, many people have called for the change of the presidential election process. Specifically, the Electoral College. Many consider it a pointless, unfair, and archaic system that denies the people the liberty of choosing their president. However, I believe the Electoral College is a necessity in modern America. Although it is as old as the country itself, it is still relevant and useful today.

The Electoral College ensures the outcome of an election. Without the Electoral College, the election may possibly need multiple reruns as a result of a tie in the popular vote. According to "Does the Electoral College work?" by the Office of the Federal Register, "The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president". With that few of electors, it reduces the chances of a tie occurring. Although it can happen however, it's not probable. For example, if two candidates ever had a tie among the popular vote, it could be resolved within the college because of the way the slates of electors are divided up among the states. Some critics of the college say that this systems takes the control out of the peoples hands and denies them the right of choice. However, you have to remember that the people elect a slate of electors to vote for their candidate. That means that even though the College ultimately decides the president, the people still have someone to represent their candidates.

The Electoral College is also a necessity because it forces the candidates to face issues the people care about and to appeal to the masses. According to "In Defense of the Electoral College: 5 reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president" by Richard A. Posner, "The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So, a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pluralarity in those states". This means that in order to win the popular vote and get a chance to win within the Electoral College, a candidate must appeal to the country, not just a particular set of voters who may have different views on politics than the majority of voters. Some people say that a candidate may try to appeal to a set of voters but in the end just use them in order to win the presidency. To that I say this. As a candidate, your ultimate goal is to serve two full terms as the president of the world's leading superpower right? Why would a candidate want to lie and jeprodize their chances at doing what they feel is right for the country?

In Conclusion, the Electoral college must not be done away with. It is a necessary tool to maintain fairness among the candidates and the election process. We have checks and balances among the government so one branch of government may never gain more power over the others so why not supervise the most important process in government? If you take anything at all away from this letter, please let it be this. The Electoral College is a staple in American politics. Without it, we would be denying our country the right to a fair election.

There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Decreasing the amount of time citizens use personal motorvehicles positively impacts the environment and the state of mind of people. The lack of driving personal cars is becoming more widely accepted in several countries for different reasons. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, is an experimental district testing the lifestyle that does not use cars. Paris banned driving for environmental reasons, and Bogota decided to try it out too. Also, it is a trend in America for the purpose of saving money and because there are other convenient options.

The decrease in fumes from cars is very beneficial to the environment. People and organizations are making drastic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. According to paragraph five of "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," twelve percent of greenhouse gas in Europe is caused by passenger cars and fifty percent in some areas of the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities because emissions from cars contributes to half of the pollution in America. In the Article by Robert Duffer, "Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog" he describes the event that Paris had to declare a ban on half of the drivers because the large amount of smog that lingered over Paris. Colombia even has a day dedicated to being free of cars to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. All of these events show the severity of environmental problems caused by cars and people making efforts to promote a better environment.

Also, a decrease in personal motor vehicles causes people to have a better state of mind. Heidrun Walter states, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." With a car comes a lot of responsibility which leads to a lot of stress on a person. Not having a car is one less bill to pay and thing to take care of which for many people is a better way of living."It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," stated Carlos Arturo Plaza on carfree day in Bogota, Colombia. The car free day has also promoted other things to bloom in the city such as parks, sidewalks, and restaurants that people really enjoy. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article "The End of Car Culture," her children have other priorities than recieving their license because they have other things they would rather focus on that they enjoy more. All of these things promote people living a healthier and happier life.

Overall, limiting car usage is a "winwin" situation for everyone. Decreasing fumes and the stress of a car causes the environment and people to be happier. Promoting public trasportation or other ways of getting places is better for everyone. It is a growing trend all over the world, and for a good reason. A lack of fumes from cars will clear the air, and clear the minds of fellow citizens.

I remember thee stories my dad use to tell me about how in cuba he would have to walk 6 miles to get to school. Or when he got here theat to work he would ride his bike to & from work. Cars are being put into use for no reason, people now a days go in thee car to to thee winn dixie theats right across thee street. Do you know how much money is put into cars? you have to pay for gas, or if your car breaks down or has a leak. Cars are a huge investment and theey are very dangerous to our society, thee pollution cars cause i horrendous. Now don't get me wrong I would prefer to go in a car on a 3 hour ride to Orlando from Naples, i mean who would want to walk 1000s of miles? but to get in thee car to get dropped off at school when you live 5 minutes away? theats ridiculous.

In Germany car use has been dropping and it has proven to provide a cleaner environment, healtheier living and huge savings. Near thee French and Swiss borders, it is forbidden to have hoe garages, street parking and drive ways. The streets are considered to be carfree zone. There are a few streets theat cars are allowed, you can park in a larage car garage or at thee edge of a development. But thee parkng space is not free thee parking space in 40,000, along withe a home. Obviously theat price is alittle bit pricey for people so 70% of theeses families do not own cars and 50% acctually sold a car to be able to live theere. The environmental Protection Agency is strongly trying to promote reducing cars andor car usage all theroughout thee united states.

What comes to your head when you theink about Paris? love, romance, coffee shops, expensive dinners on thee effie tower. How about pollution, having to stay inside because thee healthe concerns? Paris has recently banned driving due to thee pollution revolving the city of love. Motorists ere requested to leave theeir cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine, to some people thee 31 dollars did not effect theem so theey kept driving and were fined. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had theere cars impounded due to inappropriate reaction to recieving theis fine. After 5 days of what frances citizens would call torture 60% of congestion was down, believe it or not Paris was rivaling Beijing, China known for having one of thee most polluted streets in thee world! The blame was put on diesel fuel, 67% of frances cars use diesel engines. Paris has moresmog thean otheer european capitals like london or brussels. Imagine how much clearer Paris would be if theis car ban lasted a year!

Imagine how nice it would be to have zero traffic, no rush to get home. but how would you feel if thee reason behind theis traffic free day you had to ride a bike or go on thee bus? you would probably take theat traffic over a little exercise or having to stand next to a stranger. In Bogota, Colombia thee have a event called "a carfree day" in theis day colombians all gatheered as theey skated, biked or rode thee bus to get to theeir destination. If you violated theis you would have to fance a 25 dollar fine. The goalpf theis even was to promote alternative transportation but to also hope for less smog. During theis day not even rain could stop theese colombians from participating in theis event. Some people saw theis as a save thee world act also to relieve stress.

Cars are a way to travel long distances and should be used every once in a while but thee world is asking you please put an end to theis, use of cars for every little theing, start to set a goal to live a happier healtheier life and create a safe eviorment by ending car use, Start small like riding a bycicle to thee grocery store, theen decide to take a walk to thee neighbors right around thee street.

The Electoral College should remaining our countries voting system when deciding whom the president of the United States will be. The Electoral College is a process our founding fathers established as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote made by citizens Source 1, paragraph 1. Citizens elect electors who will then elect the president. This system is affective in many ways and shall not be abolished. These electors are conscious of every decision they make when deciding on our president and are here to look at things we may overlook. They are here to help us make the most affective decision. adderall, this is an enormous decision. It is the decision of whom the president of our country will be.

The Electoral College has 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President Source 1, paragraph 3. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment." This lists the candidates whom ran for president in your state and the names of their respective electors. It is a well organized and thoughtout process. This process helps us make the best decision as a country on whom our future president will be.

In source 2, paragraph 13, it states "Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning in." Candidates don't take their time in these states because they don't want their beliefs and ideas shut down. They spend some time in these states. The electors for each state help them vote wisely, therefore the absence of presence by these candidates should not be a big ordeal. People want to abolish the Electoral College due to citizens not being able to vote for the president yet they do not realize what this system has provided for us. It provides organization and avoids many, many problems that would likely take place without the Electoral College.

In source 3, paragraph 20, discusses how voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign due to the fact they have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates. These voters are the most thoughtful and should be the ones deciding the election. Also, in paragraph 22, also in source 3 it states how there is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. That pressure is reduced by the Electoral College because it produces and reveals a clear winner.

The Electoral College was created many years ago and has brought organization to our voting system. Why should we try to fix something that is not broken? Changing the system would be illogical. Electors are wiser at making these final decisions than we are. Wwe deserve an input, which we can all agree we recieve, but we shouldn't make the final decisions of our country aimlessly. Electors are people who know exactly what to look for in a president and they are more knowledgable on the subject. The Electoral College is the wisest process we can use in electing our presidents.

"The influence of social media on modern society is profound, shaping how we communicate, share information, and perceive the world around us. In this essay, we will examine the impact of social media on individuals, relationships, and the broader cultural landscape.

Social media platforms provide a platform for people to express themselves, connect with others, and access information rapidly. However, the addictive nature of social media raises concerns about its impact on mental health and well-being. The constant exposure to curated images and narratives may contribute to unrealistic standards and social comparison.

Furthermore, social media has transformed the dynamics of relationships. While it facilitates long-distance communication and the maintenance of connections, it also introduces challenges such as online harassment and the blurring of personal and public boundaries. The role of social media in disseminating information, both accurate and misleading, has also become a subject of intense debate.

In conclusion, social media is a double-edged sword, offering unprecedented connectivity while posing challenges to mental health and interpersonal relationships. Striking a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of social media usage is essential for fostering a healthy and informed society."

The United States has been known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but that's not all. It's also known for the different freedoms made available and its fair government. The electoral college is a system in which states choose representatives to vote on the president. In the past, there was a big debate on whether or not this process was fair. The electoral college is not fair or trustworthy for many reasons.

Imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. Sadly, they ended up changing their mind. You could end up with a president you don't like or believe in. Voters don't have total control over who their electors vote for. To me, that doesn't sound very fair. If everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. Based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. That means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. Our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it's our right to a fair vote.

There are more problems than just an unfair vote. It almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. In the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have separated the victor from the loser. What would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? Who would become president? I'm sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but I don't believe it could. Since there are less people making the decision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. If one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. Also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. The people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their decision, so they deserve recognition too.

The electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. Americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. Also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. America is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. So, let's give Americans the chance for a fair vote.

Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method "candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states." That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer "during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer "the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.The Senate would choose the vicepresident. Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters." Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.

Cars are great, you can get from one point to another in a short amount of time, but are they really necessary? After all we have public transportation, bicycles, and our own two feet.

The advantages of car usage can be picked up by other forms of transportation, and the environment can be saved at the same time. If car usage was limited the world and its people would be much better off. There would be less pollution, a drop in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes, less accidents, and over all a healthier planet and world population.

There would be less pollution because if car usage was limited then there would be less pollutants from the gas in cars going up into the air. Source 2 provides evidence of this, from "...days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."Duffer 10 to "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday." Additionally many people are content with not having a vehicle, or even a licence in some cases, as shown in Source 1, 3, and 4. In Source 1 Heidrun Walter explains her view on not having a car after previously owning one, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source 3, shows his support unlimited car usage by saying how it helps the environment and the health of the people in reducing stress, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." In Source 4 Elisabeth Rosenthal speaks of how her own children and Mr. Sivak's son, all avoid using cars and Rosenthal's children don't even have licenses and they are 19 and 21 years old.

The health of the people in our world would improve and there would be less people diagnosed with diabetes because they would likely get more exercise. With limited car usage people would have to find other ways of transportation, which includes bike riding, skating, hiking, or public transportation. While using public transportation would not help to improve the health of the people, biking, skating, and hiking would, as some people do these things just for exercise. So if people were forced to do one of these alternative forms of transportation, they would be exercising and getting from point A to point B all in one shot.

Not only would limited car usage help peoples health by making them be more active, but it would also help by providing cleaner air. Poluted air can cause health problems, especially in the lungs, if car usage was limited, then polution would go down, so people would be breathing fresher air that would cause less lung damage.

There would be less accidents because there would be less cars on the road. The majority of the vehicles on the road would likely be public transportation too, so the drivers may be more cautious than the average driver since they have the lives of many people in their hands.

The world would be a safer and healthier place is car usage was limited.

"Climate change is a pressing global issue that demands immediate attention and collective action. In this essay, we will explore the causes and consequences of climate change, as well as potential solutions to mitigate its impact on the planet.

One of the primary drivers of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These emissions trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include more frequent and severe heatwaves, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems.

To address climate change, nations must transition to sustainable energy sources and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. Investing in renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power, is crucial for achieving a low-carbon future. Additionally, adopting energy-efficient practices in industries, transportation, and households can contribute to lowering emissions.

Protecting and restoring forests is another vital strategy in the fight against climate change. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Preserving existing forests and undertaking reforestation efforts can help offset carbon emissions and maintain biodiversity.

International cooperation is key to tackling climate change effectively. Global agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, provide a framework for countries to collaborate in reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change. Policymakers, businesses, and individuals all play crucial roles in contributing to a sustainable and resilient future.

In conclusion, addressing climate change requires a concerted effort at the global, national, and individual levels. By understanding the causes, consequences, and solutions to climate change, we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future for generations to come."

In the newer ages, people were worried about how they would get from A to B. They would have the curiosity of what others were driving, as of Mr. Sav ik in the article The End of Car Culture said when he was around twenty years of age. Most relied on cars because it was quicker or easier to have their own. They always thought about the disadvantages of not having a car but not the advantages. Helping the environment, saving money, and safety of others are all advantages of limiting car usage which citizens fail to realize.

To start off, limiting car usage helps the environment and helps keep it clean. In Europe passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Experts say that the the main cause of the greenhouse not being able to reduce gas emmisons is because of the tailpipe of cars driven around.

For example, Beijing,China is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris,France even banned cars for five days because the air pollution was so thick. They fined people for thirtyone dollars if they refused to leave their vehicle at home. Everyone wants to live as long as they can and to have a clean environment,so why not give up your car for a few days to help contribute.

Furthermore, everyone ould love to have a little more money in their pockets instead of putting it in their gas tank. Limiting car usage is the way to go if you want to save money. In Vauban,Germany you are allowed to have a car but it would cost you an arm and a leg just to have one. For car ownership there, you would have to buy a parking space for forty thousand dollars and a home.

As a result to having to pay that ridiculous amount of money for one parking space seventy percent of Vauban families do not own cars at all. Over fifty percent of the citizens sold their car before they moved there. Having that extra amount of money helps a lot.

Therefore, the safety for others is also an advantage of limiting car usage. If most of all the people are either walking or biking their way to their destination, no one would have to worry about getting hit by a car or getting into a car accident.

In German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars , Heidrun Walter explained how when she did have a car she would always tense up while drivng. Now that she doesn't have to worry about driving she is much happier with walking or riding her bike.

In conclusion, Helping the environment, saving money, and safety of others are just some of the advantages of limiting car usage. Their not only advantages but benefits to you as well. As said in the forth article, the percentage of people getting their licenses has dropped. The miles of driven by one person in 2013 was nine percent below the peak in January 1995. Slowly but surly the trend of not using a car is not blooming in the European countries but in the US as well.

Dark matter, a mysterious and invisible substance that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, constitutes approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. Although its presence is inferred through gravitational effects on visible matter, its exact nature remains one of the most significant enigmas in astrophysics and cosmology. The Standard Model of particle physics, describing known particles and their interactions, cannot account for dark matter. Various hypotheses propose that it could consist of undiscovered particles such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or axions. Dark matter's gravitational influence is observed in the rotation curves of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the cosmos. Understanding dark matter is crucial for comprehending the universe's structure and evolution, and ongoing experiments in particle physics and astrophysics aim to unravel its elusive properties.

"French coffee culture, steeped in tradition and sophistication, reflects the intrinsic elegance and art de vivre associated with France. French coffee is not just a beverage; it is an integral part of the social fabric and daily life, symbolizing leisure, pleasure, and the quintessentially French art of savoring the moment.

In France, coffee is typically enjoyed in a relaxed setting, often in a quaint café overlooking bustling streets or serene landscapes. The café culture in France is legendary, with iconic establishments in Paris and beyond serving as social hubs and intellectual salons for centuries. Here, sipping coffee is as much about the experience and the ambiance as it is about the drink itself.

The French approach to coffee is characterized by simplicity and quality. Espresso is the cornerstone of French coffee, usually served as a short, strong shot with a rich crema. The espresso forms the basis for other popular beverages like café au lait (coffee with hot milk), café crème (similar to a cappuccino), and the famous café noisette (espresso with a dash of cream or milk), named after its hazelnut color.

Beyond the traditional espresso-based drinks, France is also renowned for its unique coffee offerings. The French press, known in France as a cafetière à piston, is a popular brewing method that allows for a full extraction of coffee flavors, resulting in a rich and robust cup. Additionally, France's culinary prowess is evident in its specialty coffee drinks, such as café viennois (espresso with whipped cream) and café gourmand (espresso served with a selection of miniature desserts).

French coffee is less about the rush of caffeine and more about the pleasure of taste and the joy of taking a moment to relax. In French culture, coffee is a ritual, a pause in the day to reflect, converse, and indulge in the finer things in life. This approach to coffee, emphasizing quality, leisure, and social connection, is what makes French coffee culture a revered and integral part of the nation’s identity."

Automobiles are the key essential to people's everyday life. It allows them to get from point A to point B. But the outcome from the rise of these machines, are the amount of pollution they had cause. Limiting there usage seems the right action to do. Our specimen has been living for thousands of year without automobiles. What's the point of using them if their risking the life of our environment.

An advantage of limiting cars could be that it lowers the amount of air pollution, which causes global warming. From Beijing to France, being as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine the amount of smog and intensity that the people have to face, having gasoline being spewed on you. On the contrary, the city of Vauban being built in 2006. It has been a prime example of a glorious city without the needs of automobiles. Kids to adults living an prosperic life, riding bicycles or just taking a stroll down the sidewalk. The store is only a few blocks away, basically all you need is a pair of legs. The whole fault in our system is due to our lack of judgement. Having our malls or stores being built nearly miles away from homes, on paved roadways or highways. Obviously an automobile is needed, but this will only cause the major destruction of our environment. Limited transportation is when we really can tell if were able to stop this rapid growth of pollution.

Our generation of kids and adults, thinks that a car is mandatory. But in reality, not every individual should own a car. From 2001 to 2009, the decrease of teens from the age sixteen to twenty one obtaining driver's license. Has dramatically declined, due to the realization of the amount of money they could save. From taking public transportation or carpooling with friends. It could help them save money, rather than spending money on gas. Which could range from 1.50 to 4.20, depending on the circumstances. These kids or adults could use that amount of money saved for future plans. Their are more pros than cons when limiting the usage of cars. The people of Bogota, Colombia celebrate a day without any vehicles. All you can see, is the broad smiles of the people's faces and utterly shocking the most, is that the streets are busy with people rather than automobiles. Imagine if were able to do such a thing, the amount of stress that would vanish. Dealing with traffic or pondering your mind to the amount of gas you need. It would simply just vanish in a blink of an eye.

If we were able to create vast systems of high tech highways to subways. Then we can manage to build programs or new forms of transportation. Without the hassle of using a vehicle, to spawning industrial factories where they are made from. An prime example is New York's recent bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing tunnel tolls. The main priority of this creation is to lower the usage of cars. Being one of the America's highly populated and dense cities. The scale or outcome of this program of limiting cars, could decide the factor if changes are possible. Then if so, then this new system can be an advantage or an example of what we can do to lower our usage of cars. That creates the majority of air pollution across the entire face of this planet.

In the end, the advantages of limiting cars or any form of transportation. Could lower the amount of air pollution, and the oncoming production of resources that affects our environment. But mainly create an atmosphere that will all humans alike to every single organism, to be able to live a prosperic life. Without the haze of dense smog, and stress of traffic jams. Thus, we can make or generate of new era of internal happiness.

The electoral college is a process where electors are sent to choose who the next president will be. Electors usually vote for who they said they were going to but can change this vote. I think we shouldn't have the electoral college anymore because, The people don't get to actually choose who they want to elect and voters can change who they're going to vote for.

The people who are voting for their president they wanted elected arn't actually voting for him. In source two, it says, "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president." This means that even if the president gets the popular vote, it doesn't mean he will always win. Electors can and will avoid the states that they know are not going to vote for the person they want to win the elections, and will avoid those states. In source two, it says "Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all." Sometimes the voters don't even get to see the electors they're voting for and some states don't get them at all. The electors also purposely avoid certain states because they know that they won't vote for them or give them a chance to swing the election.

Voters can also change who they're voting for on the spot and no one can say or do anything about. In source two, it says "In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please." People voting for who the wanted to win the election could be accidently voting for someone else because of the electors work. The elector shouldn't be allowed to change his vote, because that is cheating people out of who they think should win and making it seem like their vote didn't even matter. Some states also have more electors than others, making it so that the person one state votes for will get more votes than the other states.

Some people think that electoral college system should still be there. Source 3 says, "But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed." Even if the electors that are selected and its said that the trust is rarely betrayed, the electors can still betray the person they're voting for and it can happen and it has happened before. It also doesn't say anything about the electors avoiding states that they know won't vote for them and going to states that can swing the election.

In conclusion, people don't get to vote for who they want to and electors can do basically whatever they have to do to win. People vote for the president they want to win and can be cheated out of that by the electors. The electors are allowed to move from a state they think won't vote for them to one they think will. The electors can also change who they're voting for during the elections. The electoral college is a system that cheats voters out of who they want to vote for and seems like a outdated and nondemocratic method.

In today's world, many of us see cars as a necessary tool used to get us where we need to go in the shortest time possible. However, what many do not realize is how much restricting our usage of the personal automobile will actually help society in the long run. Decreasing our usage of the car will not only cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, but will also improve congestion and see an a boost in the economy of cities and countries around the world.

There is no doubt that cutting down on driving will greatly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. As detailed in "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, the effect of just one day of reduced driving played a significant impact on the amount of smog in Paris, France. The smog which covered the city of Paris rivaled that of Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cause of the intense fog is thought to be diesel fuel, which is the most commonly used type of automobile fuel in France. Because of this, Paris has a very high smog concentration compared to other Western European capitals. The temporary ban on driving drastically improved the conditions in Paris, and the ban was lifted after only one day. If this idea of reducing the use of automobiles spreader to other cardependent countries such as the U.S., there is no telling how much the impact of society on the emission of greenhouse gasses will reduce.

Additionally, the increasingly popular idea of favoring walking or biking over driving to one's destination has seemed to have a significant impact around the world. In the passage "Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky, the capital city of Bogota, Colombia has participated in the Day Without Cars program for three straight years. This has led to an increase in the creation of bicycle paths and cut down on congestion and traffic jams normally common in the city. In addition, the uprising of parks and recreation centers has also helped to boost the city's economy. However, this program has not been restricted to Bogota, as many people from countries around the world have come to see the event. This has the potential to become an internationally now phenomena, which will greatly improve the health and wellbeing of the people of the world. New bicycling opprotunities will mean no longer getting in traffic jams and will reduce stress and congestion in the long run.

In conclusion, the limiting of car usage would have a profound impact on our society, not only on pollution and the envorinment, but on our personal wellbeing. The limiting of our dependency on cars has had a great effect on the emission of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and smog has the potential to be removed from modern cities all together the economy would also benefit, as fewer cars means fewer roads needing to be built and an increase of bicycle trails, parks, and shopping centers in walking distance of neighborhoods. Overall, the limiting of car usage would have a fantastic impact on society and our world as a whole.

In the United States, the process to pick the president is rather complicated. From nationwide voting to states that swing from party to party, it has intricate parts that most people find confusing. The electoral college, the process that in the end picks the president, is also rather complicated. It was made to be a compromise of picking the president by votes in congress and popular vote from citizens by the founding fathers. In modern times however, most citizens agree that popular vote makes more sense and that the electoral college has become rather bloated. In the case of finding reasons of why the electoral college doesn't really work is because private citizens vote for someone else to vote and that voters from different states don't control who the electors choose.

First of all, because of the electoral college, citizen's vote counts less when they vote for someone else to vote. Most citizens would relish the chance to vote for the candidate that they choose to support. But when they do vote, their vote only just might sway the electors vote. For example, during the 2000 presidential election, instead of the intended candidate winning the vote, the electoral college choose another. It removes any sense of personal worth when participating in general elections and makes it harder for some candidates to win.

Furthermore, not only do electors choose the president, but the votes themselves from private citizens don't control who the electors choose. Electors are people chosen at state conventions, presidential candidates, and state party's central committees. The amount is chosen on the populations of such states, making smaller states with still a significant population seem insignificant. However, the biggest slight is that the votes made by the citizens don't obligate electors to choose what the general population has already choosen. It takes away control from the "people" and is inherently wrong.

In conclusion, the electoral college is rather useless because it does the job that citizens already do and takes away control from them. By voting for electors, the electoral college process takes away a sense of self in elections while giving the power to choose the president to a group of about 200 people that can be persuaded or just simply choosen by the candidates themselves. Its a bloated system and should be dealt with.

Not a day goes by that you don't see a car passing by on the street. Often, we don't think much of it and the effects it has. Throughout the world there are communities campaigning, trying to lower the usage of motor vehicles. The citizens in these communities are aware of all the cons that come with driving cars. There are plenty of benefits to not driving cars everyday such as, lower the amount of air pollution, being inclined and motivated to exercise often, and the money that this act can save.

The number of cars being purchased in America has been dwindling with each year that passes. If this pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This is due to the fact that transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just barely behind the power plants. At one point in Paris, France, there was an extreme case of congestion which provided the air with more than its fare share of smog. The city was told to momentarily stop the driving of motor vehicles. congestion went down 60 percent after five days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the world's most polluted cities. By driving a car less the environment benefits emmecely.

In Vauban, Germany it costs 40,000 to have a place to park your car along with your home. As a result from that about 70% of the families in Vauban don't even own a car, let alone drive one. Heidrum Walter notified people saying, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." She along with &0% of the citizens walk verdant streets and ride bicycles. As a result they are getting a measure of exercise more than they would be getting if the drove cars. When you excersise and sweat, your body releases endorphines which triggers a chemical in your body. The triggering of that chemical causes you to feel happier which is just what the people of Vauban are.

Some people are very well capable of purchasing a car but don't. Just that simple Non act saves them quite a handful of money. Now, sometimes things like driving a car are necessary, so I'm not saying NEVER drive your car. However, if in the cases where it isn't necessary you were to walk or ride a bike you would potentially be saving pockets of money because gas isn't being purchased as frequwntly as it would be otherwise. The reduced amount of car driving even benefits your bank account.

Motor vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles, are not always necessary. Not utilizing them comes with plenty of benefits. It reduces the amount of smog and air pollution, it makes you healthier and potentially happier, and lastly it saves you money. Walk around a little. Go on a bike ride. Experience all the beneifts of leaving your car in the garage.

To get from point A to point B, whether it be from home to the park or from school to the movies, the logical answer that pops up in everyone's mind seems to be a car. automobiles such as cars and motorcycles are widely used and are integrated into every part of society. But do automobiles really need to be so rooted into everything people do as a society? Cars and motorcycles create a myriad of problems such as congestion and smog. Some societies even legally limit their community's automobile usage to attempt to correct some essential problems. Limiting automobile usage is important, because not only is it practiced globally with tremendous success, but it also largely reduces pollution caused by diesel fuel and brings to light issues within communities and accounts for their resolution.

Automobiles are thought of as a daily commodity in most urban countries, but there are some societies in which usage has been reduced or even eliminated entirely and the positive results may be shocking. In the suburban city Vauban, Germany, residents have given up automobiles for a chance at a life free of traffic sounds and stress. This experimental journey within the town has achieved these and so much more. Their streets are essentially carfree and the lack of garages and parking space allows for up to 5,500 people to live in a single rectangular square mile with any necessary stores within walking distance Source 1 Par 6. similarlyyet on a much smaller scale, Bogota, Columbia has initiated a carfree day in an attempt to eliminate the area's pollution as well as reduce stress. The day is on its third year and has done as hoped. Additionally, Bogota's once pitted and uneven sidewalks have been since replaced and made much smoother, and the city has introduced parks and sports centers, new restaurants, and new shopping centers which are blossoming and thriving Source 4 Par 28. these changes have created a society both happy and strongly bonded. As wonderful as these positive shifts in society are, limiting automobile usage can do even more.

A limit in automobile usage can also benefit communities by reducing pollutionseeing as a large majority of air pollution is created through the release of diesel fuels into the air. Paris, France legally banned personally automobile use throughout the city in order to rid the city's air of harsh pollutants Source 2 Par 10. France experiences a combination of cold nights and warm days that trap the emmisions from cars, scooters, and motorcycles Source 2 Par 15. By significantly reducing the amount of diesel fuels rising to the air to be trapped, the smog had cleared enough within mere weeks that the city was able to entirely lifted the ban. This is a major example of the advantages limiting car usage entails.

Altogether, limiting automobile usage is key to improving society and has myriad advantages such as creating a more bonded and pleasant community and reduces environmental hazards like pollution. Creating vehicular limits is a promising way to change the world as we know it for the better.

Dear Senator of Florida, Though longstanding and "fair" to both citizens and Congress, the Electoral College is completely unnecessary and faulty. Election by popular vote is much more practical and leaves room for less errors. First off, the Electoral College warps the perception of voting, for when citizens vote, it is not directly for the president. Also, the Electoral College leaves many loopholes, which cause many issues and disputes.

To start off, the Electoral College does not allow citizens to vote directly, like a true democracy. This is unfair, unjust, outdated, and irrational. The natural right of a citizen should be to directly vote for something of a passionate matter. Controversies are everywhere, and citizens should be able to have a direct say in what is done. In What Is the Electoral College?, the Office of the Federal Register declares, "You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors" 1.6. This seems quite indirect and faulty. Can the electors be trusted? We do not know and we definitely do not want to find out. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, "...according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now" 2.9.

Moving on, the Electoral College also contains many loopholes in the system. It is very possible to have issues arise. Electors can become faithless, the number of electors for a certain state can be controversial, and legislatures can "defy the will of the people." In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, "Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John. F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy" 2.11. This unfortunate fact really shows how faulty the electoral college system really is. Do we really want so many loopholes when it comes to choosing the person who will run our country?

One may say that the electoral college has less disputes than that of just the popular vote. In In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president , Richard A. Posner says, "A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote" 3.18. However, this is untrue in my opinion. The Electoral College has already created so much controversy and dissension, along with faults and problems. For the wellbeing of our country, it would be best to simply get rid of the Electoral College alltogether.

Overall, the Electoral College should not exist choosing the president should rely on simply the popular vote. The Electoral College is not a direct way for citizens to vote, which shows signs of America not being a true democracy. Also, the Electoral College has many loopholes that are sources of dispute and issues in America. To sum it up, this method of choosing the president, is irrational, unfair, unjust, and outdated. The Electoral College should be abolished.

Dear state senator, The Electoral College that was established by the founding fathers in the constitution is important to all of us. Every candidate that is running for President in each state has its own group of electors that the political party of the candidate chose. I am however, not in favor of keeping the Electoral College but to change it to be an election by popular vote for the president of the United States, the reason being that it is unfair to the voters and outdated.

The Electoral College is unfair to it's voters. If the candidate has more electoral votes than popular votes then they have a higher chance of winning. "Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now" Plumer, Paragraph 9. The president is the leader of the United States and if most of our country votes on a candidate they think suites the best but the other candidate wins, that would make many voters dissapointed. "Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning" Plumer, Paragraph 13. Every vote counts, and the candidate that gets the most popular votes deserves the win.

Since our founding fathers established the Electoral College it shows that it is outdated. "The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" Plumer, Paragraph 14. This is the twentyfirst century, and we need to make our elections more modernized to where every voter is happy. A voter should not vote for an elector and hope that the candidate wins but be able to vote for the candidate itself. Even though there are many people against the Electoral College, it still has its defenders. "This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency" Plumer, Paragraph 9. As there are people who believe that whatever our founding fathers established we need to keep our tradition going and not change a single thing, but maybe it's time for a change. "Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than poeple who thing that single vote may decide an election" Posner, Paragraph 23.

"It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college" Plumer, Paragraph 14! The voters think the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. People vote for a candidate but the outcome is not what they were expecting.

"The discourse surrounding the ethical implications of genetic engineering has intensified as advancements in biotechnology open new possibilities. From gene editing to synthetic biology, scientists have gained unprecedented control over the building blocks of life. In this essay, we will examine the ethical considerations surrounding genetic engineering, exploring the potential benefits and the ethical dilemmas it poses.

Genetic engineering holds promise in addressing genetic disorders and enhancing human health. Techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 allow precise modification of genes, offering the potential to correct genetic mutations and eradicate hereditary diseases. However, the ethical implications of editing the human germline, affecting future generations, raise concerns about unintended consequences and the concept of "designer babies."

The agricultural sector has also embraced genetic engineering for crop improvement and pest resistance. While these advancements contribute to food security, questions about environmental impact, biodiversity, and the long-term consequences of genetically modified organisms persist.

Beyond human and agricultural applications, genetic engineering intersects with broader discussions about bioethics, consent, and the equitable distribution of benefits. Balancing the potential for scientific innovation with ethical principles requires ongoing dialogue and robust regulatory frameworks.

In conclusion, the ethical considerations of genetic engineering span a range of complex issues, from medical applications to environmental impact. As society grapples with the implications of manipulating the genetic code, thoughtful reflection and responsible governance are essential to ensure the ethical and equitable advancement of biotechnology."

To Whom It May Concern, The Electoral College that is used when electing the president is a flawed system and should be replaced by and election by the popular voted. The Electoral College does not always show what the people want and it is unfair to voters in certain states.

The Electoral College should be replaced with an election by popular vote because it is not always a fair representation of what the voters want. This means that if most of the popular votes can be for one candidate, but the other candidate wins the majority of the Electoral votes. This is shown in the article In Defense of the Electora College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. In thsi source the author states,"But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed...however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral voter will not win the popular vote.... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but fewer electoral votes"Posner, Line 16. This shows how what the majority of the people want to happen, will not always happen in this flawed system.

This system is also unfair to voters in certain states. Candidates usually campaign in what are called "swing states" that could vote for either candidate, but this means that many states that candidates are confident of winning in or states they are sure of losing in, will not be campaigned at all. This unfairness is shown in the article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. This article says,"Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad"Plumer, Line 13. This unfairness causes voters in some states to be uninformed about the candidates which could cause them to vote for people they wouldn't if they had seen some campaigning.

The Electoral College is a flawed system that is unfair to voters and does not always reflect what the citizens want.

Todays society uses automotive vehicles almost everyday. When they go to work, to go to school, to go shopping, for fun, or anywhere they wanna go. Smog has been building up from the cars pollution for a very long time. Using Vehicles less will decrease smog, improve people's health, an will be better for the earth. Using automotive transportation less will help everyone an everything in the whole world from humans to the air we breath, from animals to the grass they eat.

However, using vehicles less will decrease the smog amount all around the world. Smog affects everything so decreasing it will help everyone an everything out greatly. Banning cars for a day or banning oddnumbered plates for just one day would help out tremendously. In France they have banned oddnumbered an evennumbered plate numbers for one day each on different days. " The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban for oddnumbered plates on tuesday." So even banning vehicles one day can have a huge impact on decreasing smog. An it also clears up congestion on the roads.

However, by using automotive transportation less it will improve people's health. Walking, skateboarding, riding bicycles, or running will all improve your health. If you had to go somewhere you could walk there an it would improve your cardio. If you do this in a large city for one day a great majority of people would participate. "In Colombia, a program took place an millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work." That would greatly take a impact on the smog ratio. And all of those millions of people who participated got plenty of excessive for the day to improve their health.

So, by using automotive vehicles less it would tremendously help the entire Earth. Smog affects pretty much everything. The air that all the humans and animals breath in is polluted. The air is polluted so it affects the grass an vegetables that animals an humans consume for energy. It affects the trees that give off fresh oxygen so we can continue to breath. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Not driving would take away traffic jams therefore, people would not stress as much an also traffic jams cause a gigantic amount of air pollution so not driving would greatly help the entire Earth that we live on.

In conclusion, using automotive transportsation less would greatly help reduce smog build up, improve everyone's health, and it would tremendously help the Earth. It would lower air pollution so that the air we breath in would not be harmful to us. Even if we just banned cars for one day the whole Earth would be a lot cleaner. In the U.S the numbers of miles driving peaked in 2005 an have dropped stedily since then. People are starting to drive less and less an it is greatly helping the entire world.

I think the Electoral College should stay, because even if its "indefensible", "corrupt", "Despised" the Electoral College has its outcomes Big States, RunOffs and Presidential desputes. Its a process, Are own founding fathers who where enlightment thinkers, who thought more then what was written on the script. They thought outside the box, they wanted to know the "why" and how it will affect and how to bring this nation to its highest. Placing it in the constitution, knowing this method will do justice on future on elections. Its one of the best laid method in the world and removing it will just imbalance everything.

In the United States, each states has a majority and majority. Where people consist the most is by the coast, west and east. Its in are human nature, its been around for ages that humans live more on coastal or river areas. Any area where it consist of water,Harbor and trading routes. They receive the most of products around the world, and maintain abandons of humans. So the bigger states are California, Florida, NY, Virgina, Texas and etc. The electoral votes restores the balance. In campaigns propaganda is used alot. commercials, ads, anything they can publish themselves to show and persuade the people in elections. larger states gets more attention from presidential candidates then smaller states. Smaller states in the middle of the U.S consist of small populations so with electoral votes the weight using the population census lose by the virtue of malAppointment of the senate. Its all about propaganda that presidential campaigners use to get the big states attention cuase that where the points are at.

Electoral College avoids problem with runoffs in which no candidate receives a majority vote cast, which is the popular vote. Presidential desputes occur when a campaigner manipulates the people with spitting out promises in Propaganda ads, winning the popular vote. But with electoral college, you have a second chance to look closely on whats happening. With electoral college and electing a president you need a system. If the majority of the states and senate are republican and the president is a democrate the two partys arnt gonna agree on anything. Desputes will occure and in 4 years the country will accomplish nothing. With electoral college theres a balance of votes, each states gets there political party they voted on and it evens out when the day comes. Voting is important cuase your choosing whos gonna lead your country for the next four years and electoral college opens up many doors that will help you analysis better in whats occuring and your setting up your country system.

The electoral college may have its problem buts a system that will carry out the nation longer without many torubles then without it. Are founding fathers knew what they where doing, they thought big the U.S and look where the U.S is now. One of the strongest nation in the world, thanks to the system they created and left us.

As time progresses, more and more young people aren't buying personal cars but instead use public transport or walk to where they need to go. Other than the youth, suburbs have found this as a great way to distress as some cities, like Bogota, Columbia, have dedicated a day to stop the use of personal cars for one day. This decline of using our own cars has a positive effect on our air and the way our youth has begun to travel.

People around the world are starting to make this transition from using their personal cars to using public transport or carpooling with friends. The youth today try to mange their schedules so they can find ways to use more and more of public transit. "There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 and 39 yearolds getting a license..." Rosenthal 38, meaning that most of the youth these days are finding it easier and, though a little more time consuming, less worrisome than buying or driving a personal car. It seems getting a license isn't taking top priority for the youth. "In a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..." Rosenthal 41.Whether the youth is going to start buying cars when they have children or not, it seems the general decline of buying automobiles for yourself isn't a boom like it used to be.

Experiments being hosted all over the world in small areas also show that using no cars is decreasing pollution and allowing us cleaner air overall. In Bogota, Columbia, a program that bans all cars for one day, and despite terrible weather for the third year, and it seems that people are loving it. And despite the threatening rain, the turn out was huge Selsky 22. "...experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe..."Rosenthal 5. Our personal cars "are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States where areas are heavily populated with car owners"Rosenthal 5. Numbers like this would decline over time if we start using less and less cars. Maybe then we'd actually have fresh air to breath rather than the polluted air we breath now. Even in Paris, where they have "enough smog to compete with Beijing"Duffer 14 they banned cars for a while. "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paries enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"Duffer 10. As they enforced the ban, smog started to clear up around the city, meaning that no cars can really help clear up the air we breath in daily.

As the air begins to clear up and our youth taking a stand against owning their own cars, it seems like this could be a steady decline of personal cars and more will start using public transport. It seems time is progressing to an age where young people don't feel the haste of using personal cars and instead resort to public transport.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various industries, from healthcare to finance. Its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictions has made it a valuable asset in decision-making processes. However, the rise of AI also raises ethical concerns and challenges.

In this essay, we will delve into the ethical implications of AI, exploring issues such as bias in algorithms, job displacement, and the potential misuse of AI in surveillance. While AI has the potential to bring about positive change, it is essential to address these ethical concerns to ensure its responsible and fair use.

One major concern is the presence of bias in AI algorithms. These algorithms are trained on historical data, which may contain inherent biases. As a result, AI systems may inadvertently perpetuate existing inequalities, leading to discriminatory outcomes. Addressing bias in AI algorithms requires ongoing efforts in data collection, algorithmic design, and testing.

Another ethical consideration is the impact of AI on employment. As AI technologies automate certain tasks, there is a risk of job displacement for certain professions. While AI has the potential to create new job opportunities, the transition may be challenging for those affected. Governments and businesses must proactively address these challenges through education, retraining programs, and policies that promote inclusive economic growth.

The use of AI in surveillance is another ethical dilemma. The widespread adoption of facial recognition technology, for example, raises concerns about privacy and civil liberties. Striking a balance between the benefits of enhanced security and protecting individual rights requires careful consideration and robust regulatory frameworks.

In conclusion, while AI offers significant advancements, it is crucial to navigate its ethical landscape. Addressing bias in algorithms, mitigating job displacement, and establishing ethical standards for AI use are essential steps to ensure the responsible and equitable integration of AI into society."

Cars, they make life so much easier, or, do they make them deadlier? The amount of green house gasses has increased dramaticly over the past years, due to the gasses emitted through the tallpipes of cars. However, there has been ways that people are trying to lower these gasses. People around the world are reducing the use of cars for a more cleaner form of transportation. In Vauban, Germany residents in this community "have given up their cars"1. Also in Paris where they "enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air"10. While in Bogota, Colombia they have a car free day to "promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"20. These cities are pioneers in the way of a cleaner form of travel.

The first step is to just have a day without cars, like a new holiday. In Bogota, thats just what they have. On this day "millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work"20, and those who didn't were fined. This reduces not only smog but the stress of driving and the business of traffic jams. On one of these carfree days, even though it was raining the spirits of the people didn't dampen. Enrique rivera, the mayor of Asuncin, Paraguay, said "these people are generating a revolutionary change and that it is crossing borders"26, when he visited Bogota. As a result of these days "parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restraints and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"28.

Another way that the carfree idea is shaking up is in Paris, France. On a Monday "motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home"11, if they didnt they would recieve a 22euro fine. There smog riviled Beijing, "known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"14. however, after only one day, "the smog cleared enough on Monday that the ruling French party rescinded the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday"19.

The biggest leap, however, would be a town with no cars. Vauban, Germany is a community where "street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden"2. The streets are filled with "the swish of bicyles and the chatter of wandering children"3 instead of motors and horns. This expirimental town has sparked a new way of life a cleaner, safer way of life.

We have gone on thousands of years without cars, and after they were introduced they polluted the air and caused us stress. So if we could go on without them before, then why can't we now. As demostraighted by Paris, Bogota and Vauban life isn't that bad without a wheel to sit behind.

We, the people of the United States, live in a car happy society. Every teenager can't wait until their 16th birthday because, for mostly every kid, that means that they go get their drivers license and possibly their very own car. Also, adults always look at getting a nice luxurious car and the top make and model of that year. Well, without a shadow of doubt, we should adopt the plan to cut down our usage of cars. It seems very successful considering 70% of vaughn's families don't own cars. It is detrimental to our country.

In case you haven't noticed lately but there is lot of pollution in the air.

According to article 1 , anywhere up to 50 percent of carintensive areas in the US make up the greenhouse gas emissions. It is depressing seeing all of this smog and pollution in the air everyday. Just a little heads up but the pollution increases every single day we use cars. It is a shame seeing such an extravogant and extraordinary country go to crap due to pollution. If you want to see how every state is going to look if we keep relying on cars then go to California and see how much of an eye sore it is. Cars are one of the major factors responsible for smog and pollution. Polution from your car can lead to animals dying and especially humans dying from your automobile.

People today care lot about making and having lot of benjamins . Everyone wants to be rich and have the most expensive types of stuff, lets face it who doesn't. If you cut back on putting money towards your car then that would save you a ton of money. Just imagine if you didn't own a car, think about all of the things you would't have to buy and pay for. Cars are expensive just to buy in the first place let alone having to pay for gas and maintain it and all of that stuff that needs to be done to it. Also say goodbye to the mechanic visits and having to deal with the stress that comes from them. It would cost less money to not own a car and just take city transportation via bus or taxi or even car pool. You could even go the healthy route and ride your bike or walk to places close by. There are many cheaper ways of getting places besides cars.

Cars can be very dangerous at times and driving can be as well. You are at a greater risk of getting into a car accident than getting into a bicycle accident. Car accidents happen everyday and most of the time they are fatal. Coming from personal experience trust me, being in a car accident is not fun and is really scary and nerveracking. It can also haunt you for the rest of your life. I almost lost my dad a couple years ago due to a terrible car accident that we were involved in that wasn't our fault. He hasn't worked since that day because he hasn't been healthy enough to do what he was doing. We both, still to this day, feel the gruling affects from that accident physically, mentally, and emotionally. It took a toll on us and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder what would of been if we didn't get into that accident. So wouldn't you feel more safe in a bus knowing that your less likely to get hurt than in a car.

Without question it is neccesary to cut back on car usage and start going green and using public transportation instead. Cars are a crucial part of our pollution today and that can easily change. All signs point towards the better option being to take a step back from cars for a little bit and see what the result is. Atleast once a week say that you can't use cars as transportation. This idea seems very good and well thought out and it will definetly show improvements that we want to see. So lets do it and see how much it affects our country.

Dear State Senator, I am agreeing in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There is no need to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. That is because the House of representatives helps elect for us, it helps us to balance our votes, and avoid problems of election. The electoral college helps the people out alot with the voting situation and helps us to better understand and know our new president.

The broader significance of the electoral College is that the House of Representatives helps us vote for our new president. In source One paragraph three it says "Your state's entitled allotment of electors equal the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each number in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."That tells me that we the people are not alone in this process of voting who will be our next president. Also in the same source but paragraph five it states "The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party." This informs me that not only the House of representatives is involved in the elections. Tthe government is important to the electoral College because the votes of the government count most to the College.

It is evident that the Electoral College helps us to balance our votes. As stated in Source Three "The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..." This lets me know that we as the people won't have to worry to much about the voting and selection of the president. Another piece of evidence stated in the same source and paragraph "So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..." That states that not all people and states have to worry about who the president will be. The Electoral College hepls us out alot mostly to the big states in the United States.

Above all the Electoral College avoid problems of the elections. In source Three, paragraph Twentytwo it states "The Electoral College avoids problems of the elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast." This lets us know that the Electoral College is doing a good job on keeping the votes clean and simple to understand. Also stated in the same source and paragraph "There is no pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential electionn process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which ivariably producess a clear winner..." That tells me that the Electoral College is keeping the votes on point.

There are some people out there who don't agree with the Electoral College and dont like the way the votes are being put in because sometimes the president that they chose wasn't elected. They are wrong to disagree with the Electoral College because the College keeps everything going in order and in a clear path to let us know who our president will be. As stated in Source Two paragraph Ten "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in tur elect the president. This makes them disagree because they think that the Electoral College doesn't vote for their president, but they souldn't worry because they way they vote is by how many states helped the electors to vote for that presient being chosen as the president. Also In Source Two "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states." That makes some people diagree also, but the Electoral College doesn't count how many people in each big or small state voted for president. All the college does is help the governmtent elect for the president that they most support and elect for.

I agree that the Electoral College should be kept in favor because of all the help that it gives us and the government. Also the College helps us stay balanced on the votes so that nothing gets missplaced or missunderstood. Most of all it avoids problems during the election so that the people and the government are satisfied with their votes. The Eletroal College is a great way to keep things going at a clear election of the year. The Electoral College doesn't need any changes for me because even if they chose on the elections of the government the votes of the people still count to them as well. The votes of the peopel are important to the Electoral College just as much as the government's votes are.

Dear Senator, I believe that the United States deserves someone who will lead this country to do the right thing, to make independent choices, and to be the best version of ourselves we can be every day. Now, how do we know when choosing a leader to represent us if thats what we will achieve when voting? We don't for sure, but we can make judgements and calls that will give us a better understanding to whom we are choosing. One of the biggest fought over rights was the right to vote, in which everyone wanted. Now that we have that vote, we should be able to use that freedom and have a say in who we want to represent us. Therefore, I think we should change the election to popular vote for the President of the United States rather than relying on the Electoral College.

The Electoral college consists of 538 Electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party and given their own says and responsibilities. That being said, I think that getting rid of the Electoral College will eliminate all biased decisions and will create more freedom and responsibilities for the people of the U.S. to use their own judgement and choose who they think will best represent the country. Being in the electoral college and being selected to have a heavy say in who will be chosen is a big responsibilty and in that responsibility are duties to not only look at each candidate with one mind set and one point of view but to make an unbiased judgement. To make an unbiased call would mean to put away all your own thoughts and judgements and really get a good understanding of who the people truly need. Back in 1960, it states that segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. How can we tell that something like this will not happen again? Well if we choose to keep the Electoral College it very well could and the people of the country would not be making decisions for themselves as well.

Most worrying comes from the fear of a tie, in which the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one single vote. That single vote from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters could have as much say as the 55 representatives from California who represent 35 million voters. So therefore the election is really only a few swing voters away from a disaster. Because of the winnertakeall system, candidates really dont spend time campaigning in states they think they have no chance of winning, really only focusing on the bigger states with more votes. This is also unfair because then the people with the right to vote do not get a say in who they want to represent their country. The Electoral college really takes away many rights and freedoms to the people of the U.S. and doesnt give us the chance to have a say. Studies even show that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now!

As well as having such a biased voting system, this is such an unfair system due to the fact the the popular vote winner could loose because of the Electoral College voters. This would be a very bad decision to keep the Electoral College especially if these Electoral voters have had their decision swayed by something. Then we will have a president that is only the president because of some voters biased and unfair judgemented calls. If one Electoral College voter has a certain view on a candidate, they could very well share that and somehow persuade the other voters decisions due to one persons thoughts and points of view on the candidate. One person can easily influence many peoples own judgements, which would cause them to choose poorly and only go under the pressure of that persons thoughts. The Electoral College has so many cons which would make it such a bad decision to keep this system and go by a biased and unfair advantage. So I believe that the best thing for the U.S. voting system would be to abolish the Electoral College and to keep the popular vote system so that everyone has their own say on who will achieve great things for our country.

Who are voters voting for? Whoever they are voting for, it certainly isn't the president. The Electoral College has the potential to cause a nationwide catastrophe, which is why changing the election to popular vote is the best way. The Electoral College should be abolished because of the "disaster factor", prospect of a tie, and the fact that more citizens vote in the presidential election compared to the electoral election.

The disaster factor is exactly what it sounds like: a disaster. This "disaster" is described as the event where electors defy the people they are representing. For example, this happened in the 2000 presidential vote when Al Gore won the public vote, but lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush. This means that the electors voted by the people of their state changed their minds about which president they were voting for. This resulted in the opposing vote turnouts in the 2000 presidential election. As said in Source 2, "In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please." Although some people may argue that it is very rare for something like this to happen, the fact that there is a chance that it could is overwhelming. Clearly, against even the smallest odds, the Electoral College can cause a catastrophe.

A tie would cause a real predicament in a presidential election. In the case of a tie, the choice is given to the House of Representatives. This means that there is an unequal amount of electoral voters. Source 2 says, "Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people." Once again, the Electoral College has faulted a simple tie could throw the whole election off. Why would the vote be passed on to the House if there is already a popular vote? If there is already another vote in place and the votes are counted, why not just put those votes to use? Obviously, if a tie could mess up a national vote, then it's time to change our ways.

Although each state decides its electors, how many people are actually voting for the electors? According to Source 3, about onehalf of the eligible American population voted in 2012's presidential election. If only half of the population is voting for a nationwide presidential election, how many people are going to vote for a small, instate election? It isn't clear enough that although the presidential election is bigger, the electoral election is much more important. However, if we just had a popular vote instead of the Electoral College, everyone would vote in the presidential election because everyone already knows the importance of the presidential election. Yet, people aren't aware enough of the importance of the electoral vote and although the government has tried to stress the importance of voting it, nobody seems to catch on. It is evident that a large percentage of the population does not understand the need to vote in the electoral election. People simply do not understand that this election determines the outcome of the presidential election, which is why it shouldn't even exist.

The Electoral College is regarded as a nondemocratic method of selecting a president. It is true hypocracy and should be replaced because of the "disaster factor", prospect of a tie, and the fact that more citizens vote in the presidential election compared to the electoral election. The presidential election isn't a nationwide election it is an election that takes place in a little room where 538 electors decide the political fate for millions of people living in the United States of America.

Could you imagine your life without a car? It seems impossible if cars wouldn't exist. Did you know that there are cities where people have'nt used their cars for a whole day? While in others people dont ever use cars. People think that without a car they're nothing, and that life is totally different. But there is something very interesting happening around us, in other countries which is the reason why they've stopped using cars for a while. The polluted air due to cars in doing no good for us. Think about it, maybe you could might live without are car for a day for an important cause.

First thing first, we should learn how people live in other countries without a car. It sounds weird to us, but it's something normal for them. There is forbidden to have home garages and to park cars on street in Vauban, Germany. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, Germany has gone from a city with cars to people giving up their cars. "street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders"Rosenthal, paragraph 2. This place is "car free" except for the downtown area and a few streets of the community. She also states that other countries like the US experiments more problems in pollution."passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the US"5. People walk way more in Europe, they dont suffer much from air pollution.

Additionally, Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. These cities have stopped using their cars for a while to help calm the air pollution. "On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31" Robert Duffer, paragraph 11. Although that people were not supposed to us ehtier cars that day, 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. The cause for not driving for that day was because the cold nights and warm days caused the air to trap car emissions. Another reason for car free in Paris is because of the micrograms found. "Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London, Rueters found"Duffer, 17. Its an advantage to prevent car usage because the smog is clearing in these cities.

In similarity, millions of Colombians hiked, walked and did many other activities without touching a car to prevent the smog. These cities are working together to make the world a better place. "In a program that set's to spread to toher countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday"Andrew Selsky, paragraph 20. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, and they achived it. That day without a car was an improvement camapign in Bogota. Surprsingly, in the US recent studies have stated that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less each year that goes by. "if the pattern persists and many sociologists believ it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the environment"Elizabrth Rosenthal, paragarph 34. There has also been changes in the US. Driving less has stopped air pollution.

In conclusion there are benefits without a car. Benefits for the world around us, and well you might get some stress out if you start walking, hiking, or riding bycicles for a while. It's incredible just to think of the idea that many countries have stopped driving for a day to make their country or city a better place. While in cities like Vauban, Germany people live without cars. Thats what makes their city different. Even though they do also let these things happen for a right cause. I think that we could live without a car for one day, it's not a big deal, really. It's to make the US a better place.

To begin withe, I want to inform you theat car usage has become worse and worse over thee years. Our healthe is in jeopardy because of how much we use cars. But withe limiting car usage around thee globe anyone can become a healtheier person. A great percent of our population in the United States are overweight or obese. Even all over thee globe! Withe limiting how much time we use cars we can reduce theat percent and become healtheier people because theat way we can walk to our places and not just sit down in a car doing absolutely notheing. People have become much happier in limiting theeir car usage. Those people go out and get fresh air and not sit in a car going from place to place. And withe being much happier has come less stress. People who are too stressed are not to happy theat's why its better not using a car just to go grocery shopping. You wouldn't have to worry about thee lights and stop signs or be scared if your going to be in a car accident. The only time you should be able to use a car is going long distances and places like otheer cities.

To move foward, Global Warming has become a really big issue for us. All thee pollution theat Planet Earthe gets from cars is absurd! Cars release so much gas and harmful substances theat we breathee in. It doesnt only affect us but animal too and all living theings. Now thee smog has gotten way worse. Paris has a huge percent of smog covering thee city theat even France has enforced a partial driving ban to clear thee air of thee city. Congestion has gone down to 60 percent. Beijing, China is known as one of thee most polluted city in thee world. Now everywhere you go even if its really cold nights arent as cold as theey used to be. Cold nights and warm days have caused thee warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

Anotheer theing about limiting car usage is theat you can even associate withe otheer people around you.

For decades, society has put a major emphasis on transportation in order to center themselves around cars and ways to upgrade them. However, it is this frame of that mind that has created issues for modern society. If there were limitations put on the usage of cars, then those rules would help maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create a feeling of bliss and serenity that has disappeared since the mass production of cars. So unless change is brought upon society, then people will be passing up on benefits that would better the whole world.

Scientist have long realized that cars are a major cause to the pollution brought into society. From the waste produced while turning precious oil into gasoline, to the engines in millions of cars simultaneously burning gas. It is for this reason that limiting the use of cars would assist in saving and maintaining the environment. According to Robert Duffer, the author of the article "Paris Bans Driving Due to Somg", "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog." What is also noteworthy is that this experiment by France officials was only in place for a matter of days. So after having smog that repotedly rivaled Beijing, China, the smog capital of the world, the smog that inhabited France was more than cut in half. If this can work in such a large scale like France, then it isn't unreasonable to believe that this same process can be done in other major regions. Saving the environment has become a priority around the world in recent years, and the idea of limiting the usage of cars could help to achieve that goal.

Aside from the fact that the limitation of cars can save the environment, it can also save car owners money. When a person stops at a gas station to fill up their car, they can expect to spend between twenty and fifty dollars. However, if cars were to become less relevant, then this money can be used to fund other important aspects of a persons life. While this might seem farfetched, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, "the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter." This analysis helps to justify the fact that cars can eventually become less relevant and thus save people money. Also, money would be saved on not having to repair and maintain a car, or having to buy a car in general. This alone can save a carowning household thousands of dollars each year.

Saving the environment and money are always an obvious choice when explaining the benefits of limiting car usage, but another benefit would be obtaining bliss and serenity around the globe. Since the mass producion of cars, cities are always filled with the irritating sounds of a lively road. This has left many people to enjoy their walks, not to the sounds of children laughing and people conversing, but to the beeping and screeching of cars. However, in a city in Germany called Vauban, officials have successfully created a peaceful city that relies on walking and public transportation instead of cars. According to Heiden Walter, a media trainer and citizen in Vauban, "When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." This quote goes to show that the citizens don't feeled resticted, but released from their reliance on cars. So although it may seem difficult, putting limitations on cars can create a happier populants.

Putting a limitation on the use of cars would not be a punishment like some would see it, but a way to better society. This limitation would help save and maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create bliss and serenity amongst people. As modern society continues to push forward and develop the next wave of advancements, putting limitations on the use of cars should be seen as a serious inquiry to leaders around the world.

The breeze of the late summer air, it's fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coincided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.

To begin with, banning carsreducing them will benefit our ecosystems and environments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing Source 2. That CO2 rises into the air, the atmosphere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of carpooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3 and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael siva brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn." Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, "Mine 19 and 21 speaking of her children have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.

Alongside with the bettering the environment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the citytown. In Bogota, Columbia according to Source 3 new paths have been opening up, "It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city," stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.

In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the environment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and checkup like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice.

The struggles in many peoples lives rely on timerelated events such as work, school, and other priorities. These time limits have been built up through our transportation and the bumps that come with it. Traffic is an obvious limit on peoples time every day. However, if traffic was nonexistent, how could these struggles be taken away? Simple, everybody gets to their destination without polluting the air or wasting time behind cars walking or using a bike is the way to go. Avoiding the usage of cars has many positives such as, being free from time constraints with transportation, being more active, and being an avid "green" human that is saving the Earth.

Traffic is all around us, whether it be internet or transportation traffic. The usage of cars has limited job arrivals because of the time that should be taken to drive to the job site. Yet, job sites should be centered around the employees as cars should toned down in the first place. "... stores are placed a walk way, on a main street, rather than in malls in some distant highway." Source 1, this quote directly supports and addresses a problem that has been prolonged for too long. Restaurants, sporting good stores, and shopping malls have all corralled themselves in areas that are too distant for consumers to readily access. With cars slimmed down in numbers, stores would be in place for the consumer and the employee.

"...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital eerily devoid of traffic jams." Source 3. When being are more active throughout the day, occurrences such as this are allowed to happen much more often. A day free of cars in Bogota left streets almost completely traffic free which in turn reduced smog and allowed for alternative transportation.Source 3. Cars allow us to ride through hundreds of miles with just the use of a few muscles. Running just 1 mile burns hundreds of calories and gets people feeling good. When people are fit and healthy, they feel better about themselves and have more confidence. The limitation of cars would allow this feeling to arise in thousands of people. People felt so good, they let nothing stop them "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating," Source 3.

Saving the Earth is extremely important and many people are aware of that. However, very few of those people take action. This is primarily because of the way our daily lives are ran. Work is a necessity to support for one's own and their families, so getting to work, whether by car or by bus, is something that will not stop. However, the alternativees of tranportation allow us to reach that goal without using gasemitting cars or buses. Bikes and even hybrid cars are now rising up in today's society "A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009". Source 4. Young people have a strong influence on society and if they worry less about the car that they are driving or even driving at all, then there is certainly something going on. Cities are now also taking part in this action, "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city... Congestion was down 60 percent in the captial of France..." Source 2. A simple temporary ban can not only change the mind of an individuals view on using other alternativees for tranportation, but also allow them to experience those alternativees.

The consequences that cars toll people with today are greatly weighing on an individuals daily life. They have their schedule built around their car and are constantly being time constrained because of it. The effect greenhouse gases have on the Earth is huge and has not stopped. In order to help the Earth in this parituclar topic, this action would be miraculous. Not only do many people become lazy and very unhealthy because of cars, but they also take for granted what they can do without them. Hiking and other activities are missed out on the daily because of these vehicles. Many people can accomplish new goals and set new goals if it were not for certain transportation methods.

A decision tree, a prominent machine learning algorithm, structures decision-making in a tree-like model. Nodes represent decisions, branches signify outcomes, and leaves denote final decisions or predictions. The algorithm evaluates input features at each internal node, guiding the path to subsequent nodes until a leaf node is reached, yielding the final decision. This method accommodates both categorical and numerical data, offering interpretability through a visual representation. However, decision trees may suffer from overfitting, addressed through techniques like pruning and ensemble methods. Despite challenges, decision trees stand as versatile tools, finding applications in classification and regression tasks with a balance of simplicity and effectiveness.

"Arabic cuisine, a rich and diverse culinary tradition, is deeply rooted in the history and culture of the Arab world. Spanning across countries from the Middle East to North Africa, Arabic food is characterized by its aromatic flavors, varied spices, and the emphasis on hospitality and sharing. This cuisine reflects the region’s historical influences, climate, and the ingenuity of its people.

A cornerstone of Arabic cuisine is its use of fresh ingredients, herbs, and spices. Ingredients like olive oil, garlic, sesame, dates, and honey are staples, while spices such as cumin, coriander, cardamom, and cinnamon add depth and complexity to the dishes. Meat, particularly lamb and chicken, plays a significant role, often seasoned and grilled to perfection.

One of the most recognizable aspects of Arabic food is mezze, an array of small dishes served as appetizers or a meal itself. Mezze can include hummus (a creamy chickpea dip), baba ghanoush (smoky eggplant dip), tabbouleh (parsley salad), and falafel (fried chickpea balls). These dishes are usually accompanied by flatbreads like pita, essential for scooping up the delicious dips and salads.

Main dishes in Arabic cuisine vary regionally but often feature grilled meats, rice, and vegetables. Kebabs, grilled skewers of marinated meat, are popular, as is kabsa, a fragrant rice dish with meat and vegetables, seasoned with a blend of spices. In coastal regions, fish and seafood are commonly used, prepared with the same rich blend of spices and herbs.

Desserts in Arabic cuisine are typically sweet and rich. Baklava, layers of phyllo pastry filled with nuts and soaked in honey syrup, is a favorite, alongside other sweet treats like dates, kunafa (a sweet cheese pastry), and qatayef (sweet stuffed pancakes).

Overall, Arabic cuisine is not just about the food; it’s about the experience. It's common to share meals, reflecting the region's emphasis on hospitality and community. The diverse and flavorful dishes of Arabic cuisine, combined with the warmth and generosity of its people, make it a truly enriching and delectable culinary journey."

Last year in 2014, the earth had the warmest temperature in recorded history. Needless to say, this is due to greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide. One of the major reasons behind an increase in greenhouse gases is due to the use of cars and motorcycles, which release high amounts of carbon dioxide. It is to our benefit that we prevent any form of unnatural climate change on earth, and the most effective way to execute this is by living a more "carfree" life, especially here in the United States as it is our second most contributing factor of our increasing greenhouse gases. America could follow the path that many other countries and cities took.

In Vauban, Germany, cars have been banned unless one should decide to buy a permit in the form of a public garage. Most citizens take other means of transportation than cars. They walk, use bicycles, or public transportation. This has resulted in Vauban having a much cleaner environment and less stress as a result of no traffic. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," confesses Heidrun Walkter. Building suburbs like Vauban would result in a lower production of air pollution and a much more stress free environment.

Bogota has a similar policy as Vauban, but only lasts one day of the year. However, that only serves the citizens to be more enthusiastic about the event. Most people were glad to help out in anyway to reduce the smog. Bogota has also inspired other cities to do the same. Cali and Valledupar also decided to encourage this ecofriendly day. A day might not be much out of three hundred and sixty four, but a small contribution from a large mass of people can make a huge change. Implementing this same policy in more cities and countries would result in a notable change in the amount of air pollution around that time of year.

Paris resently executed a policy to ban cars with oddnumbered plates on Tuesdays as a consequence from a heavy smog that was brewing for several days. Paris had a smog of higher concentration than London, having 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter while London only had 78.7. There were residents who were unhappy with the ban, but the benefits the city gained from it were outstanding. Traffic was down by 60 percent and and as a recompensation for those who could not use their cars, public transportation was free from Friday to Monday. Due to the dedication of the mayor and citizens, the smog cleared up enough for the ban to be lifted. Making this a something a whole nation can participate in would definately improve the annual greenhouse gas emmssions.

Limiting car usage can have a posotive heavy impact on the world as a whole if more people were to follow the examples of these cities. The year of 2014 was known as the hottest year in recorded history, and it undoubtedly has to do with how much greenhouse gasses we emmited. If we could follow the example of those cities, we could see a great change by the end of the year 2015. This change could fix the climate problems we're currently having, and create a healthier, happier world.

"The field of biotechnology has witnessed remarkable advancements that have transformed medicine, agriculture, and industry. In this essay, we will explore the impact of biotechnology on various sectors and discuss the ethical considerations surrounding its applications.

One of the significant contributions of biotechnology is in the realm of medicine. Biotechnological innovations have led to the development of therapeutic drugs, vaccines, and gene therapies that have revolutionized healthcare. Personalized medicine, guided by genetic information, is becoming increasingly common, offering tailored treatment options based on an individual's genetic makeup.

In agriculture, biotechnology has played a crucial role in improving crop yields and enhancing food security. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) designed for pest resistance, drought tolerance, and increased nutritional content have been developed to address global challenges in agriculture. While these advancements hold promise, they also raise concerns about environmental impact and the long-term effects of GMO cultivation.

The industrial sector has also benefited from biotechnological applications. Enzymes produced through genetic engineering processes are used in various industrial processes, from the production of biofuels to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. These sustainable and eco-friendly practices contribute to reducing the environmental footprint of industrial activities.

Despite the positive impacts of biotechnology, ethical considerations surround its applications. Issues such as genetic privacy, the potential misuse of genetic information, and the unintended consequences of genetic modifications require careful attention. Establishing ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks is essential to ensure the responsible and equitable use of biotechnological innovations.

In conclusion, biotechnology has transformed various sectors, offering solutions to complex challenges in medicine, agriculture, and industry. While celebrating its positive contributions, it is crucial to address ethical considerations and implement responsible practices to harness the full potential of biotechnology for the benefit of humanity."

Does the Electoral College work? Are you happy with a group of electors choosing your president? I write this letter to you, our state senator, because, like many other U.S citizens or residents, I have my own opinion. I am in favor of the idea of changing to popular vote. Electoral College does not work, it is unfair to voters because a president with the highest popular vote could not win,and it could be "disaster factor". Many are familiar with this term: "compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens"What Is the Electoral College?,1, but how does it benefit us? Does it express our opinions and preferences?

Lets go back in time to the election of 2000, The candidate with the most popular votes was Gore, therefore, everyone was expecting him to win. The majority was happy with the outcome until they counted the electoral votes, Bush had more electors on his side than Gore. Nobody understood why, they gave the country the president less wanted. despite the fact that it was the first time since 1888, because it happened once and for sure it could happen again, Why did all those people voted if they got the president they didn't trust to rule their country? In History class, my teacher told us: "This country's foundation is for the people to rule the government, in other places like Italia, Argentina, Spain, etc. the government takes care of the people, like it they were our parents." I believe we stay true to the foundations and let the people choose the president they want.

"The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system alloys for much worse"Plumer,1. This quote is based on 1960,when people who favored separation based on race nearly Democratic electors were replaced with the ones who would oppose Kennedy. Many electors make a last minute change in their decision and they decide to go over to the other side and vote against their original choice, the party's candidate. "When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"Posner,1.

Another reason why this system should be abolished is the winnertakeall system. The candidates do not spend time in the states in which they believe they have no chance of winning. States had not even seen the candidate and in some cases, they even haven't seen a poster. For example, Plumer says in a expert from "Mother Jones" that "During the 2000 campaing , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and Soth California, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a dingle campaign add." The Electoral College system is unfair to the voters.

Overall, My beliefs and the beliefs of hundreds is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters because it can be the cause of some major disaster and it can choose the candidate the public is not haoory with. The votes are people who want to express, or show, political preferences, people who are determines to change their country for good, so give them the right to do it. "It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!" Plumer,1.

I think that the electoral votes should not decide who the president is. This is a nation where people have the right to vote, and the fact that the votes of the people don't even matter is not right. What is the point in even voting if our vote doesn't count, what is the point in the candidate giving speeches to the people if it's all just for nothing. The popular votes are the ones that should be counted towards who becomes the president. People all over the country are told to vote, or are guilted into voting becomes it's a right that we should be happy and proud to have but then the vote that we put on the ballot doesn't make a difference, it's the electoral votes that really matter. What makes them more important than us. The electoral votes are not democratic.

Yes the electoral college does somewhat balance out the big states from the little states based on population but that still doesn't matter. If over 50% of the United States votes for one person but then they lose to someone with a little more electoral college votes then are they really our president, we the people didn't vote for him so then why is he allowed to be our president. The founding fathers gave us the right to vote but the truth is that the vote isn't really real. I think we should just change it so that the people are the ones that get their votes counted because you can't tell us to go voted and then not even let it mean something. Being able to vote is one of the things that we have that most other countries don't have, but the reality is that our vote is disregarded and somebody else makes the vote for us.

Do you think that people are going to want to vote for someone if it is basically just a waste of time. If the votes actually counted I bet a lot more people would go to the polls. People would be more interested in the speeches and wanting to listen to their views if they knew that their vote was important to the candidate. In 2012 only about a half of the people who were eligible to vote didn't and that number could keep getting lower if we don't change it. The younger generation doesn't care right now because they already know that their vote doesn't matter.

The electoral votes only have five reasons as to why they should stay.

Incase of dispute over the outcome Everyone's president Requires candidate to have transregional appeal Winnertakeall method awarding electoral votes Balances the small states and the big states population Avoid runoff elections Avoids both candidates havingno majority The electoral votes don't seem to be very American. The whole electoral college system is confusing and as said in the passage "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. If we were to have a vote and the peoples votes actually counted that asked people if they want to keep the electoral college or get rid of it I bet over 50% of the people in this country would want to get rid of it.

The people, the people, the people that's all you ever hear presidents talk about. "I care what's best for the people" or "It's the people's vote", if that's true though then why do we still have the electoral college. The electoral college is a creation of our founding fathers and yes it might have worked then, but times have changed. The electoral college is now just taking away the people's votes, has the disaster factor', and because of the electoral college many candidates only focus on swing states.

To start, if it's all about the people then how come our votes don't count. Instead of voting for the president we are voting for who the electors vote for, if they even follow what we say. Although the exerpt from "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" disagrees with me, in paragraph 18 they give the perfect example to prove my point. In the 2000 election of Gore and Bush, Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but still had fewer electoral votes. In other words the people voted for Gore, but instead we got Bush! So if it's all about the people of this great country then why did we not get our choice of president.

Next, the disaster facter' is described in source 2 otherwise known as the excerpt from " The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong". In paragraph 11 it talks about how in 1960 the segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature tried, and nearly succeeded, in hand picking electors who they believed would be opposed to Kennedy. So what if next time do they succeed and the vote doesn't go the way the people want. As if that isn't enough reason, also in 1960, Hawaii sent two slates of electors to Congress! Luckily, President Nixon saved the day or that could have been yet enough fiasco the electoral college created.

Lastly, when candidates know for sure they don't have a states vote or even that they do have a states vote they tend to not visit those states. In source 3 it says that it makes them a more successful president because they don't only have regional appeal. However, it also makes it so they aren't connecting with every regional only the swing states so what about the states that are for sure to one canidate do they just not get to hear from their future president? The idea of an electoral college is making it so only certain states get to talk to the candidates and that's not fair.

In sumamary, why do we need the electoral college if all it does is cause problems. You could say that there's less of a chance of the larger states over powering the ones with less population, but at least then it's in the peoples hand what happen. The electoral college takes away the peoples power, has the disaster factor, and the candidates ignore certain states. All in all the electoral college is causing more problems then we need, let's finally make the election the people's vote.

"The field of genetic engineering has opened up new frontiers in science and medicine, allowing scientists to manipulate the genetic code of organisms. In this essay, we will explore the applications of genetic engineering, its ethical implications, and the potential impact on future generations.

Genetic engineering involves the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using various molecular techniques. This technology has diverse applications, from producing genetically modified crops with improved traits to developing gene therapies for treating genetic disorders in humans.

One of the significant applications of genetic engineering is in agriculture. Genetically modified crops are designed to possess specific traits, such as resistance to pests, tolerance to environmental conditions, and increased nutritional content. These modifications aim to enhance crop yields, reduce the need for pesticides, and address global food security challenges.

In medicine, genetic engineering holds promise for treating genetic disorders and advancing personalized medicine. Gene therapies involve the introduction, removal, or correction of specific genes to treat or prevent diseases. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic disorders, offering targeted and individualized solutions.

While genetic engineering offers remarkable benefits, it also raises ethical concerns. The ability to manipulate the genetic code raises questions about the potential misuse of this technology, including concerns about designer babies, genetic discrimination, and unintended consequences. Establishing ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks is essential to ensure the responsible and equitable use of genetic engineering.

In conclusion, genetic engineering has the potential to bring about significant advancements in agriculture, medicine, and beyond. As we harness the power of genetic manipulation, it is crucial to navigate the ethical landscape and implement measures that prioritize responsible and transparent practices. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of genetic engineering for the benefit of humanity."

The Electoral College is a process made by the founding fathers for the election of presidents by the congress vote. The Electoral College is a process, but it is an unfair process. Americans are supposed to vote for who they desire to be president, not a group of electors in Congress. There is no possible way for Americans to choose their president if at the end of it all, a group of electors make the final choice. According to the Office of the Federal Register, Americans choose the state electors when voting for President because when voting for president, Americans are actually voting for the candidate's electors. It makes no sense then to vote for a president, let's just make it to where we vote for electors because we obviously aren't voting for who we want as president.

The main purpose of voting is to help the candidate American voters want as president to win the election. If popular vote was the way to determine who would be elected as President, everybody would be happy. There are times in an election when everybody is sure that the candidate they voted for is going to win. Americans watch as they see the votes go up by popular vote, but then later, the candidate they thought would win has lost because of the Electoral College. If popular vote was the way Presidents were elected, everything would be made easier without controversy. However, since the Electoral College does play a big role in the election of presidents, popular vote is never going to be a working system. Americans just need to figure out that their vote is never going to really count, but the Electoral College's vote surely will.

In an article by Bradford Plumer, the fact that over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than how we vote now is stated. The Electoral College System is based on Americans voting for the electors that are the candidate's party. When Americans go to vote, they vote for electors who support the President and then the electors choose the president. When Americans go to vote, the banners should just say Vote For Electors. When Americans vote, it is made to seem as they are voting directly for the President they want to be elected. Instead, Americans are actually voting for electors. Multiple times you'll hear the saying, "Every vote counts." but really, every vote does not count. No matter how many times Americans vote for their President, the Electoral College has the final say no matter what American's votes are.

The major problem that worries many, is the problem of a tie in the electoral vote. During an election when a tie occurs, the state delegations vote for who will be president. According to the article The Indefensible Electoral College by Bradford Plumer, each state is able to cast one vote and the one single state representative makes the decision for the state. If the point of an election is for the people to vote and choose, there shouldn't even be a option for the one representative to choose. All the votes that were just cast by Americans all go down the drain now. In the case of a tie, all the power and weight goes to the one state representative to choose who becomes the president. The represtative does not care about what the people want, that representative will choose what they want to do with this election. According to Bradford Plummer, during the 2000 campaign, Rhode Island, South Carolina and fifteen other states did not even get to view media markets or campaigns and did not even get to see the candidates. Those states howeve still voted, not knowing anything about these candidates because overall the Electoral College makes the last call.

The Electoral College is an unfair process that also plays a big role in elections. No matter how Americans vote, the Electoral College is going to be the people who elect the president. Americans vote for who they want as their president but the Electoral College simply makes that decision for you. Americans shouldn't even vote, the Electoral College can make that decision. Many people in America simply want the popular vote than to have the process of Electoral College in place. We should all take a vote to abolish the Electoral College. But wait, the Electoral College might say no since they always make the overall decision.

I strongly believe that the Electoral College should remain the way it is or, better yet, that we should elect the president by popular vote. This is due to the fact that the Electoral College does not accurately reflect the will of the people. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, an estimated two million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump however, Trump won the Electoral College vote, 304 to 232. This means that a candidate can win a majority of the Electoral College voters while losing the popular vote! Furthermore, voting for President should be an individual citizen decision, not a state decision. The Electoral College works by awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the winner of the majority of votes in the state. This means that a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not receive any of that states electoral votes. This goes against the concept of onepersononevote, since a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not win any electoral votes. By eliminating the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote, the votes of every individual will be counted, and the candidate who wins the most votes nationally will win the election. In conclusion, the Electoral College does not reflect the will of the people and votes in state are not equally weighted. It is time to elect the president by popular vote and to finally give the votes of individual citizens the weight they deserve.

The economy, a complex system of production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, shapes the financial landscape of societies. Rooted in the principles of supply and demand, economies are influenced by factors such as government policies, global markets, and individual behaviors. Economic systems vary, with capitalism, socialism, and mixed economies representing different approaches to resource allocation. Macroeconomics examines the broader economic trends, including inflation, unemployment, and GDP, while microeconomics focuses on individual markets and consumer choices. The global economy, increasingly interconnected, is subject to fluctuations, and events such as financial crises or pandemics can have far-reaching consequences. Economic indicators and policies guide decision-making, and discussions surrounding income inequality, sustainable development, and technological advancements underscore the multidimensional nature of economic considerations in shaping societies and individual livelihoods.

"The concept of universal basic income (UBI) has gained traction as a potential solution to economic inequality and job displacement in the face of automation. In this essay, we will explore the principles of UBI, its potential benefits, and the challenges associated with its implementation.

UBI proposes providing all citizens with a regular, unconditional income to cover basic living expenses. Advocates argue that UBI could address poverty, provide financial security, and allow individuals to pursue meaningful work without the fear of economic instability. However, critics express concerns about the affordability of UBI and its potential impact on work incentives.

Proponents of UBI point to pilot programs and experiments conducted in various countries as evidence of its positive effects. These experiments suggest improvements in well-being, education, and entrepreneurship among recipients. However, scaling UBI to a national or global level requires careful consideration of economic feasibility and funding mechanisms.

The implementation of UBI also intersects with broader discussions about the future of work, technological unemployment, and social welfare systems. Crafting policies that address the evolving nature of work while promoting economic inclusivity is a complex and ongoing challenge.

In conclusion, the concept of universal basic income offers a compelling vision for addressing economic inequality. As society grapples with the impact of automation and economic shifts, thoughtful exploration and experimentation with UBI may provide insights into creating a more equitable and sustainable future."

To whom this may concern, The "winner takes all" system we've been using doesn't work. Less power is essentially being given to the people, and, some are even being ignored.

In cases such as Al Gore's, the people said yes, and the College said no. And, voters didn't like this. According to a gallop poll in 2000, after Al Gore lost the race, "over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now", meaning, or. Senator, it's time for change. In addition, this system easily allows for a tie. In this event, the results of the race would be decided by the House of Representatives, which we all know would swiftly put in a vote for the Republican candidate. And, since the Senate has also been recently dominated by Republicans, they too would choose one of their own, resulting in two branches of the government dominated by one political party.

Moreover, with this faulty system, many people are being ignored. As you may recall or not, "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."Source 2, Paragraph 13 Although not seeing the ads might not have been a bad thing. I'm just kidding. Why is this important? Because the people need to see and meet their candidates, but due to the electoral collage, people are being ignored. If the majority of the votes are known to be going to one candidate or the other, they will most likely not be visited by either side, because whom that state's electoral votes are going to are essentially locked in. The only states that recieve any attention are the "Swing states" Source 2, Paragraph 13 that are pretty equal on both sides and can be easily swayed to pick one candidate or the other.

The only evidence to refute my claim would be that "Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation" Source 1, Paragraph 7, which actually might work however, this would require all the states to change their policies, which we all know won't happen very easily.

So, in summary, or. Senator, the way things work is going to need to change, we are being ignored and elections are being thrown. If you don't help us change this, the power of electing the president is going to remain with our, faulty, college.

All around the world, people are using gasgusling vehicles of mass destruction. Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the "CarFree Day" in Bogota, Colombia, and the partialdriving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeccessing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a longterm positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases is one of the common issues troubling countries worldwide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depletion of Earth's Ozone layer. According to Source 2: Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog, "The Smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world... Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found." The city of Paris had legislate, "On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day" . Resulting from their legislation, "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday" . Paris, originally one of the worlds' mostpolluted cities, decreased their pollution so much in one day that it was deemed unnecessary to continue the ban for the oddnumbered license plates the next day. "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States" Article 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . A decrease in these emissions could have significant effects, as witnessed in Paris. Also, a Local Colombian businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza claimed that the CarFree Day was "a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" Source 3: CarFree Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota . The government and their factions are in agreement that the ban on cars is only positive. Whether it is Colombia, Germany, or Paris, the restriction on drving was a major success. Imagine if more countries around the world opted to institute this ban there would be no energycrisis nor would there be as much of a pollution issue.

Along with the decrease in pollution, there would be a massive decrease in traffic. The vehicular limitations in the betacountries France, Colombia, and Germany have shown that the restrictions imposed decrease the amount of traffic significantly. Based on Source 3 , in Bogota, "... a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." Rather than having a holierthanthou complex, these Colombians supported the greater good of their country and ceased use of all cars on the carfree day. A positive domino affect occured in Colombia as well. According to Source 3 , "Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." These beta countries have improved the standard of living by meerely putting some restrictions on driving for brief periods of time. The United States has seen various changes as well. While there are no current driving restrictions, new priorities are being discovered, such as the bikesharing program in one of America's most heavily trafficed cities, New York. According to Source 4: The End of Car Culture , "New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a poliferation of carsharinf programs across the nation." Nations are beginning to catch on to the contagious cold of revolutionary alternatives to driving and traffic crises.

France, Germany, Colombia, and the United States are already seeing positive changes. The longterm culture shift is proving to be an aspiration for many countries. According to Source 4 , "The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of city centers has made the suburbs less appealing and has crawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work." People are becoming more connected through digital devices as societies become more technologically advanced, therefore the need for a large amount of privately owned cars has become moot. In Vauban, Germany, Heidran Walter, a media trainer and mother, claims, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" . Commoners, such as Mrs. Walter, are respoding positively to the laws of the experimental district of Vauban, which has very few areas and opportunities for cars. In fact, "70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here" . This modernday industrial revolution is drawing vast numbers of people into the areas inwhich cars have become a rarity.

Source 1 also states that "Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning"." The beta countries have had much success and have not seen failure yet. Although in France, "Almost 4,000 dricers were fined... Twentyseven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine" , it should not be considered a failed experiment. Of the millions of people who live in France, they only saw a small fraction of driving infractions on the day they limited driving. The longterm culture shift that the world is beginning to see is certainly moving in a positive direction.

Between ISIS and the iPhone, the world has come across a variety of both positive and negative circumstances. Considering all of the positive effects of limitations of cars, including but not limited to less traffic, a decrease in pollution, and longterm culture shifts, there have been many advantages to the switch to a carfree enviornment. Even though transportation may take longer, it will be safer and better for the enviornment. Not everyone country can guarantee that all of their citizens will abide by the new laws, as shown in France, but a small fraction of the trouble is better than the mass population of millions, and in some places billions, wrecking havoc on the planet.

Dear state senator, I ask you to change the voting methods to popular vote instead of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency dont need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.

Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the result them being elected as president or not. According to "The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer "Seventeen states didn't see the candidates al all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get so see a single campaign as. "You may ask yourself why they didn't see any of of this well one thing that both of them share is that they dont have as many electoral collage votes as other states like california that has 55 electoral votes. And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all.

You dont have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the presidency and its a winner take all. According to the "The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the bestlaid defense of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer "Voters vote not for the president, but for a slater of electors, who in turn elect the president." For example when bush was running for president he was not the most popular in the nation and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more then half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.

However According to "In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. "The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting methed to The Popular voting to elect The President Of The United states Of America because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesn't have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A.

I'm iure Heidrun wain't the only one who felt like that.

Having no car wouldd take more itreii of your life then you think. You wouldn't have to pay a car payment every month. You wouldn't have to worry about having to pay for gai to get around. Laitly you wouldn't have to worry about getting into a car accident every time you got behind the wheel of a car.

Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the Electoral College, must be changed. Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote. The Electoral College is unecessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated. Source 1 says that the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. This begs the question, how can a system so old still be practical and in use today? This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.

There are so many things that could go wrong with the Electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives. According to Source 2, if this were to happen, than, "the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters." This, of course, would not reflect the nation's vote, and would anger millions of people. If we elected the president by a popular vote, than the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.

Another flaw of the Electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election. Even though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3. "It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes." This is a major flaw of the Electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people. Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation's vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system. This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the Electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.

The popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States. According to Source 2, "over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." If this is the preferred voting system, and the Electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote? It only makes sense. Not to mention, if the Electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of who the nation wants as their leader.

Some may argue that the Electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it "produces a clear winner," Source 3. But, the information given above disproves these unvalid arguements. If the Electoral College is such a great system, than why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation's votes still win the election? Will it always produce a clear winner? What about the event of a tie? Or, what about when the "winner" did not win the majority of the votes?

In conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the Electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary. The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.

For years, the United States has been mass producing and using cars. It may sound surprising, but America has already reached its peak when it comes to buying cars source 4. More and more people around the globe have begun to realize the benefits of using alternative means of transportation. Places such as Vauban, bogota, Paris, and even New York have implemented programs to encourage the limited use of cars. The idea of giving up such a comfort may sound tragic at first, but reducing car usage has many advantages.

We use cars everyday for pretty basic purposes. To get to work or school or to run errands are just a few examples. Now, imagine what would happen if a car were not available to you. It probably would not be the end of the world. You could catch a bus or ask for a ride from somebody. If you really needed to, you could even ride your bike or walk to wherever you needed to go. People in the past tended to fear using alternative transport, for varying reasons. Maybe friends or family are not willing to give rides. Maybe the sheer thought of walking a mile may seem terrifying or ridiculous. The most common reason is probably that having a car is just too covenant, it seems that there is no need for any other way of transportation! But life can and should be adjusted to fit into these sources of transport. In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents have given up their cars in favor of a life without them source 1. I just proves that contrary to popular belief, cars are actually not a necessity!

Citizens in Vauban, Germany walk or ride bicycles when they need to go someplace source 1. It's almost needless to say this, but they have a much healthier lifestyle than most carowners in the United States! They are not afraid of walking or riding a bike a bit to get where they need to. Not only are these people in better physical shape, but one mother, Heidrum Walter, tells us that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now that she has given it up, she seems happier source 1. Carlos Arturo Plaza, in bogota, Columbia, says that using his bike on their annual nocar day reduces his stress levels. There is a direct corrolation between physical activity and mental wellbeing. The more activity, the better you feel. By limitting car usage, we are also encouraging the physical exercise that comes in place of it, making us a happier, healthier community.

Maybe the most important reason to reduce car usage is to protect our enviroment. By obtaining and burning fossil fuels, we are both running out of this resource and posing the threat of spills and air pollution to our environment. The gasoline we use to fill our cars certainly won't last forever. It won't even last for much longer at the rate we are burning it at. Also, spills can be devasting to the ecosystem it impacts, as we have seen in the past, for example the BP oil spill. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage to the gasoline we use to fill our cars is the air pollution it leaves behind. Transportation is the second leading source of emissions in the US, behind power plants source 4. Also, in Paris, the smog from automobiles got to be so bad that they set laws to ban cars on certain days source 2. Just by reducing car usage for a few days, the smog cleared tremendously. It wouldn't be hard at all for each individual in this community to cut back on the amount of time they spend driving in their cars, if for no other reason than to keep our Earth clean.

Over the years, we Americans have grown accustomed to relying on cars for our every need, but we can't do that anymore. As a community, we need to open our eyes and see the changes happening around us. Cars are not a necessity. We don't even need to completely get rid of them, but it is neccesary for us to cut back, for the sake of our health and our environment. It may take some getting used to, but I promise, it is more than possible. In the words of Bill Ford, we can soon move forward to a world where "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve saftey." source 4.

From Monster trucks to Volkswagen Beetles, all automobiles are created to make life easier for people from all corners of the Earth. Many people start up their cars everyday without a second thought, whether trekking across the street or across the country. Others believe that cars are ruining the Earth, and put effort toward decreasing their car's "footprint" on the environment. People everywhere should consider limiting their car usage.

A community with less cars has proven to also be one with less healthy citizens. According to Source Two, Paris, a city known for it's aromatic scents, was covered with the smell and appearance of smog for days they had nearrecord pollution: Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. After a day in which all evennumbered license plates were banned from the streets of Paris, the smog cleared up a great amount enough for the city officials to take the ban they had placed for odd numbered license plates the next day. The smog that was affecting the wellbeing of Paris' citizens had mostly disappeared after only one day of limited car use. If a community limits cars, its inhabitants will be almost forced to exercise more. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, where a "Day Without Cars" is held yearly, 118 miles of bike paths have been constructed, the most of any Latin American city. Less cars on the road in this city have led to other means of transportation being more popular, including walking and bicycling. These ways of getting around are much more healthy then their gaspowered alternative. Less traffic on roads will therefore leave cities healthier than otherwise.

There are many more reasons why citizens should limit their personal car use. Owning a car is huge investment. You have to pay for gas and oil refills for any standard car based on how much it is driven. Because of this, limiting car use would also limit the pressure on car owner's wallets. According to Source One, the majority of residents of Vauban, Germany don't have cars. This city is an example of a worldwide effort to make suburbs denser. Because of this there is no need for automobiles to commute across the city. The purchase of a car, which costs thousands to even millions of American dollars for the average buyer, is unecesssary for the residents of this town and therefore can lead to better financial stability.

Cardriving, the catalyst to the wonders of travel, will continue to drive on the pollution of our Earth. Babysitters, doctors, students, and even the retired will thrive from limitations of car usage. Whether by limiting car usage or not, Earth's inhabitants need to ensure their planet is treated right.

I think that we should change to popular vote for president of the United States. Instead of the electorsal College. I think this for a lot of reasons, one is because you dont vote for the president but for the electorss. It is unfair because they have a winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to decide. electorss can defy the will of the people. The electorsal college should be changed to popular vote for the president.

First, you have to vote for the electorss not the president. Then only if they win there votes go through. You can't even control who the electorss vote for. Voters sometimes get confused on who there voting for and vote for the wrong electors. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than what we have now.

Then, they have the winner takes all system. Also candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even see a campaign ad. Though they established electorsal college in the constitution Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all, agreed on abolishing the electorsal college.

Lastly, electers can defy the will of the people. The state legislatures are resposible for picking the electorss. If there is a tie between the electorss then the state gets to decide. Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate he then validated only his opponent's electorss. He made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if this possibly happens again?

The electorsal college should be changed to popular vote for the president. This should be done because the electorsal college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. You also dont vote for the president you vote for the electorss. Its also unfair because of the winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to vote for the president. The electorsal college should be changed to the popular vote for the president, because the electorss can defy the will of the people.

Cars, they help us get from point A to B in a shorter amount of time, but at what cost. Cars are a large source of stress, produce large amounts of pollution, and seem, even now, to be going out of style. Cars are a luxury, not a necessity, and now they might not even be as useful. More and more people are putting down the car keys and choosing instead to take a bike or bus. Cars are just too stressful to be a necessity.

In Vauban, Germany, many people are giving up engines. According to the New York Times, "70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars," showing that life can go on efficiently even without a car. Life might actually improve without those money eating tanks. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" says Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. This car free philosophy is even becoming a trend! There are hundreds of groups in the United States promoting communities that are more independent of cars, called "car reduced" communities. But stress isn't the only thing cars produce. Cars are huge contributes to pollution, and reducing car usage would greatly benefit the environment.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent is some carintensive areas in the united states, according to the New York Times. Paris actually enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of nearrecord pollution. The ban was enforced with a 31 fine. Even with 4,000 drivers fined, congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared enough that the ban could be lifted the next day. Using more environmentally inclined sources of transportation will definetely help leave a cleaner planet for future generations, and the generations already here. Cars are convenient for short term gratification, but the long term effects might devastate the environment. Cars are not needed, and might not even be preferred for much longer.

A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 in the united states. Bogota, Colombia even becan a "carfree day" in with all cars, besides busses and taxis, are banned in this capital city of 7 million for an entire day. Violaters of this ban are fined 25. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Plaza. This event is even starting to spread. For the first time two other Colombian cities have joined the event. Using cars is becoming less and less common, and it's a trend the environment can enjoy.

In conclusion, cars are a hiderance. Cars are stressful and cumbersome objects, getting rid of them would help reduce stress in the population. Cars are high contributes to pollution, creating smog and causing problems. Also, cars are a comodity that is being used less and less. People are putting down the car keys and picking up a bike.

Here, in the United States, birthplace of the Model T,driving has proven to be part of our history and culture. However, with recently uncovered developments in our environment such as global warming and pollution, it is time for us to reevaluate our "car culture". Overusage has proven harmful and limiting alternatives that reduce stress, are just as effective in getting us from point 'A' to 'B' and are more ecofriendly.

Our excessive car usage is dramatically hurting our environment. In fact, "...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States" 5. What people use for our short term convenience is actually proving inconvenient for us in the long run. In Paris, there was "147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London" 17. The culprit? Diesel fuel emissions from transportation cars. To underscore the severity, the smog in Paris is so bad that French Officials had to limit car usage in a smog cloaked city that "rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"14.

This issue is mirrored in Bogota, Columbia, where the government has also stepped in and established a car free day in which perpetrators get fined in order to " promote alternative transportation and reduce smog" 21. Efforts such as these can be effective in aiding our environmental crisis. After France also instate a limit on car usage "the smog cleared" 19. By limiting our car usage we can actually make a difference in reducing pollution and make our living environment more pleasant and healthier.

The switch is facilitated further not only by the inclination toward a better worldy environment but a less stressful social one as well. In the city of Vauban in Germany, residents have " given up their cars"1. Here although car ownership is allowed, "70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there." 3. Do the residents regret their decision? According to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two: "When I had a car I was always tense, I am much happier this way"3. In Bogota, a business man, Carlos Arturo Plaza who participates in Bogota's movement to reduce car usage says that the absence of cars is an "...opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" 24. These are two individuals on different continents with families and busy lives who find the lack of cars to be not a handicap but actually a source of stress relief. In France, after the restrictions of car usage the streets also became less stressful for people who have to drive like taxi drivers or public transporters because of a "60 percent reduction in traffic congestion" 14.

For those who do decide to make a move to help the environment and themselves by reducing their car usage, their are more and more alternatives that are making their switch worthwhile. In Vauban, you can hear the sounds of viable alternatives in use. The "swish of bicycles" and the "chatter"3 of walking children is audible in the streets. Carlos Arturo Plaza rides the carfree streets of Bogota on " atwo seat bicycle with his wife"24. For those who don't feel comfortable with walking or cycling other options such as carpool exist and governments are now making more of an effort to make other alternatives such easier and more available i. e. public transportation. In Bogota, in order to support the movement toward less automobile driving wide sidewalks have been made. In Vauban the whole city has been constructed with the goal to make everything compact and easier to access by foot or bike. This is good news for those who make the early morning busness commute as their job is closer to where they live and more convenient to walk or bike to than other suburbs in which commuters are forced to take the high way because of the distance. Also, the more people who take advantage of whatever public transportation available to them will make the demand higher and cause more funding to be placed on public transportation. Before "80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to high ways and only 20 percent to other transport"9, but with more usage, this can change.

Essentially, the sacrifice of some of our car usage is far outweighed by the positive affects on our environment and attitudes.

Man conquered its environment with advancements and technology, they make life easier but some are harmful to our environment. Automobiles were derived from carriges but unlike carriges automobiles required some kind of power to run on. Most vehicles in modern day run on gasoline, Diesel, or electricity. They make transportation easier for us but like every good apple it has its rotten side. Fumes produced by the burning of Diesel and Gasoline are harmful to our ozone. The fumes produce a greenhouse like effect and trap in the heat contributing to global warming. Although diesel engines have improved and are now cleaner our atmosphere is still taking a sucker punch. Almost every family in the United States owns an automobile, thats millions and millions of people driving increasing carbon emissions. If less people used their personnal vehicle they could save money and diminish the amount of pollution produced by their automobiles. There is no way we can obliterate car use because we have built our world centered on car use but we don't have to stop driving we could simply reduce our impact by using public transportation, walking or riding a bicycle. Walking or driving a bicycle could relieve stress while commuting and traffic jams increase your stress level do something for yourself and our environment and decrease your stress level.

The are many many reasons to decrease our reliance on automobiles yet even with many benefits we refuse to do our part. The amount of fossil fuels available in earth is limited, in the past decades we have used much of it there will soon come a day when we will experience a shortage of fossil fuel. The day will come regardless of anything because of our reliance in this source of power but we can slow down its arrival by using less. Americans use thousands and thousands of dollars a year to fill up their tanks, when they could walk or car pool and save money. They could use that money to pay bills, make improvements in their home or make a college found for their kids. Yet many preffer to drive and just burn their money away. The use of public transportation doesn't only save you money it can increase your comminities economy.

While i'm all for saving money there is a greater cause then just saving money. Although is obvious we could all use a few extra bucks in our wallet we could also use a healthier planet. We breath in the fumes that automobiles produce, carbon is not good for us its a health hazard. We are polluting the air we breath our body needs oxygen not carbon and yet that's a high percentage of what our lungs inhale. There is also the concern that carbon emissions are causing holes in our ozone layer. The ozone protects us from all the harmful rays that the sun emmits like Uvrays. There has been an increase of people sufferring from skin cancer in the last decade. why you may ask, well carbon emissions make holes in our ozone layer which in essance allows harmful sun rays to reach us. With a certain amount of exposure to radiation our cells experience mutations caused by the harmful rays and essancially give birth to cancer. Many people die because of this disease and we lament their loss but not enough to make a change. Pollution produced by automobiles has many negative effects on our environment, and health. We could decrease the damage by doing our part and leaving our car parked in the garage.

If saving money and having a cleaner environment isn't a good enough reason to limit you car usage then do for your own health. There is more to life then just driving impatienlty in a car you could walk and enjoy nature. Our reliance on cars is unhealthy for us and our environment. We are polluting our beautiful planet and causing an increase of health hazards. There is only so much fossil Fuel left we can waste it all at once or make it last a little longer. I myself enjoy the pleasure of just driving to a store rather than walking but i preffer a healthy environment over a car ride. Do your part walk, take a bus, or car pool with your friends. Every grain of sand counts.

Dear state senator, We should not decide the president by electoral college. Mainly because it's unfair to the voters who took the time out of their day to vote, but then realized they wasted their time because their vote doesn't mean anything, the electors decide who the president is not the voters. The article the Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong states "Under the electoral college system, voters vote for not the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." What's the point of voting if our vote basically doesn't matter because we are not the one choosing who is president. The same article also states "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always" We the voters basically don't even decide who's president, the electors do, and we don't even get to pick who the electors are, the state legislatures do. Why is the president based off of who the electors want? there's only 538 of them, it should be based off popularity, the vote of the millions of the people who have voted. Honestly i see no point in voting now since our votes don't decide who the president will be.

Electoral college is unfair to the small states. The article five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president' shows a map of America with the number of electoral votes given to each state. If you look at the map, you'll notice that the bigger states have more electoral votes, and the small states have very few. For example California has 55 electoral votes, Texas has 38, and Florida has 29. But states such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine have less than 5 electoral votes. Which basically means that their electoral votes don't count nearly as much as the big states do. If we decided the president by popularity among everyone who voted, it would actually be fair to everyone, and more people would vote.

The article five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president' states "Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now" I don't blame them when the artcile also states "This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose presidency." Then what's the point of voting when our vote doesn't matter.

Dear, I believe that the way of voting for a president though the Electoral College is outdated. The popular vote should be deciding who becomes president. Some Runnerups have had the backing of the popular vote and not won because of the Electoral College. Several things you should consider is people can actually vote though popular vote, the minority will have a better chance, and presidents have lost to the Electoral College.

First, People can actually vote, when people go to vote for the next president or the returning one they arent actually voting for the president they are voting for electoral votes but some state wont even allow people to vote for that. Some states the electors vote for who they want and the peoples votes they are accounting for become nothing. They go out and vote for nothing. " Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."source 2 This is what can happen when poeple can vote who they want and u have electors doing it for them they will put someone in the race that no one wants to really be there. But some poeple say that the Electoral College is there to help us and to help most states have the winner take all system. " The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states."source 2 which means that they won't visit every state because there is no reason to visit some.

Next, The minority will have a chance, If there ever is a deadlock in the campaign the voting will have to go to the house which will be mostly filled with the majority side. So the minority won' have much of a chance." Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state." source 3 that means a close election isn't so close anymore because of Electoral vote. But some people will say u can never get a tie. " A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538 is an even number."source 3 continuing on that note, Runnerups have lost due to electoral vote but have won the popular vote."According to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore tanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost presidency."source 2 Which means Al Gore would have been president and not the other guy. Which would have changed today in one way or another. Some people do say The electoral vote is for the better. " The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President." source 1But why do they get to vote for them and we dont.

In Conclusion, The Electoral College should be eradicated and the popular vote should take its place. The popular vote is better because people can actually vote, the minority will have a chance, Presidents loss becasue of Electoral Vote but win the Popular vote. In the end the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational.

Dear Senator, I know that you have many issues to think about and have a lot of decisions to make, but I think it the subject of the Electoral College is a very important subject for you to ponder. The Electoral College needs to be changed, we need to vote for the presidency with the popular vote. I believe that the Electoral college needs to be taken away because it's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.

First, the Electoral College should be changed because it is not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College. The people ar voting for the president, but not really. They are actually voting for a slate of electors, who then choose what candidate there electoral votes should go to. The whole point of a democracy is to let the people of the country have a say in who is in charge, but with the Electoral College this is not happening. The people are saying who they want for president but if the slate of electors does not agree, then the votes go the other way. This was expressed in "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong" by Bradford Plummer. In the passage he says, "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes." In addition, the Electoral College should be abolished because the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate. The Legislature is technically responsible for picking electors and theywould very well pick electors that are all against a certain candidate. Everyone says the system is so strong but is it really? The fact that a group of people opposing one candidate could be the electors for that state and could totally changed the votes doesn't make the system look so strong. Plummer adressed this situation in his passage, he stated, "Back in 1960, segregationista in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors wiht new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. so that the popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy." Finally, the Electoral college system needs to be taken away because it is very confusing. The whole system is just a jumble of different things. There are so many different steps and processes that tend to confuse the voters. When the voters get confused they often end up voting for the wrong candidate or making a mistake. If the voting system was just, the voters voted for who they pleased, then the votes were counted, then all the votes from states are added together, and then whoever had the most votes won, the whole thing would just be much easier. I belive that when the situation is as impportant as voting for our president, it should be as easy and flawless as possible. For example, when I was in seventh grade, I learned about the Electoral College in civics class. learing about the Electoral College was one of the hardest and most complicated thing I learned that year. How are people supossed to vote, if they have no idea how the system works?

In conclusion, I believe that the electoral college needs to be abolished becauseit's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.

Since the car was first created there has been many innovations to different types of cars. However, studies have shown that in the last few years the percentage of people getting a license has dropped. There are many advantages in limiting car usage not only in the city but also in the suburbs.

The first of these advantages has to due with our never ending problem with our environment. For example, as stated in source number 2 the city of Paris had been very polluted. To solve this problem the ruling party in France enforced a driving ban. After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. because of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

Another advantage of limiting car use is that once these cars are gone people are much more sociable. In source 1, the government of Germany has created a suburban community where there is no cars. Car ownership is allowed however there are only two places to park and it is very expensive. Because of this 70% of families in this community do not own cars. To get around in this community you are able to walk, ride a bike, skate, etc. As a result, you do not hear cars on the streets but you do hear bike swishing and kids playing with eachother. Many studies have also shown that a day without a car is a very effective stress reliever, as stated in Source 3.

Now a world without cars is very hard to imagine because of all the different places that everybody has to get there however, there are many alternatives to using cars on a daily basis. These alternatives include public transportation, bikes, skates, walking, and also car pooling. If there is a reduction of car usage the environment will receive a very large benefit.

As the articles provided has shown, there are many advantages to the limiting of car usage and it will not only benefit us as humans but also our environment.

Dear fellow citizens of America it has come to my attention that pollution in the United States is getting worse so I have a solution use cars less. It is simple, this will help cut pollution in the U.S as the second biggest polluting factor is gone and can actually help you with a better social life as well as helping rebuild the community.

As mentioned earlier,cars are the second leading cause of pollution in the U.S and cutting that will help stop some pollution by stopping one of the biggest causes. Stopping the use of cars will cut the carbon in the air and this in turn can lead to a healthier lifestyle as well. There are many neighborhoods that are carless and we have received good results from said neighborhoods as well as car free day is becoming a hit in Columbia as well as other parts in central America. This will also make smog a less likely occurrence as no car fumes are getting trapped therefore, cleaner, unpolluted air. This will help prevent the same pollution levels like in Paris pop up here.

A life without cars can also positively affect the social lives of many people. As people are more likely to just walk and talk with friends or just walk or bike to the park. people in carless community like Vauban have even said they feel less stress now that they don't have cars. Young Americans have even started losing interests in cars and would rather take public transport or carpool with friends then just take their own car. And as a result are tighter with their friends and family then before.

People who use cars for transport are less likely to use the sidewalk or ride their bike and as a result sidewalks and bike paths are uneven and ragged. Therefore without cars, things like disrepair sidewalks or roads would come to our attention. For example Car Free Day in Columbia led to the repair of sidewalks and 118 miles of bike roads and more sport centers parks and shopping districts have started to pop up. Getting rid of cars can help us rebuild the community with more parks and public centers and hangouts. This will also lead to better security as less people will get hit by cars, less car accidents and overall better security.

In conclusion my fellow citizens, please consider makeing this community carless. for their are many advantages for doing so in this community from the enviromental, to the social and to the health benefits.

"Tesla, Inc., founded in 2003 by a group of engineers including Elon Musk, has revolutionized the automotive and energy industries with its innovative approach to electric vehicles (EVs) and sustainable energy solutions. Initially focusing on high-end electric sports cars with the Roadster, Tesla's ambition was to make EVs mainstream, countering the perception of them as lackluster alternatives to traditional gasoline vehicles.

The introduction of the Model S in 2012 marked a turning point for Tesla. This luxury sedan shattered preconceived notions about EVs, offering impressive range, performance, and cutting-edge technology. The Model S's success proved electric cars could be desirable and practical, leading to wider acceptance of EVs globally.

Tesla's impact extends beyond just manufacturing cars. Their development of Gigafactories, massive facilities dedicated to battery production, addresses one of the biggest challenges in the EV market: battery cost and availability. By scaling up production, Tesla aims to reduce battery costs, making EVs more accessible to a broader audience.

Moreover, Tesla's innovations aren't limited to vehicles. The company's foray into renewable energy solutions, like solar panels and the Powerwall, a home battery product, underscores its commitment to sustainable energy. Tesla envisions a future where homes and vehicles are powered by renewable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental impact.

Tesla's influence is evident in the auto industry's shift towards electrification. Traditional automakers, once skeptical of EVs, are now investing heavily in their own electric models, signaling a major shift in the industry. Tesla's vision of sustainable transport and energy solutions continues to challenge and inspire, making it a pivotal player in the quest for a greener future.

"The role of renewable energy in addressing global energy challenges and mitigating climate change has gained significant attention in recent years. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, offer sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels.

In this essay, we will explore the benefits of renewable energy, its potential to transform the energy landscape, and the challenges that must be addressed for widespread adoption. The transition to renewable energy is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing energy security, and creating a more sustainable future.

One of the key advantages of renewable energy is its environmental sustainability. Unlike fossil fuels, which contribute to air pollution and climate change, renewable energy sources produce minimal or zero emissions during electricity generation. Solar panels harness sunlight, wind turbines utilize wind energy, and hydropower systems harness the power of flowing water, providing clean and sustainable alternatives.

The decentralized nature of many renewable energy systems contributes to energy independence and resilience. Distributed generation, where energy is produced close to the point of use, reduces the need for extensive transmission infrastructure and minimizes energy losses during transportation. This can enhance energy security and reliability in diverse geographic regions.

Despite these benefits, the widespread adoption of renewable energy faces challenges. Intermittency and variability, inherent in sources like solar and wind, require effective energy storage solutions and grid management strategies. Additionally, the initial costs of renewable energy technologies and the need for supportive policies may present barriers to entry.

In conclusion, renewable energy holds immense potential for transforming the global energy landscape. By embracing sustainable alternatives, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, mitigate climate change, and build a more resilient and environmentally friendly energy infrastructure. Overcoming the challenges associated with renewable energy adoption is crucial for creating a sustainable and equitable energy future for generations to come."

Dear Senator, The topic of the Electoral college is a hot one, and the idea of whether of not to adjust it is controversial. Many citizen disagree with the process while many are in favor. What should we do? We should change the Electoral College. The voting is based more on quantity instead of quality, and the voting is not coming from the citizen's directly, making the risk of an unfaithful candidate too high and the actual voting less popular and more electoral. When one stateor even one person could change the whole ball game that is the Presidential Election, then what does that mean for our democracy?

While many will argue that it is a fair way to vote, the Electoral College has many flaws. First off, the candidates are focusing on more power and higher tallying states to get them through the election than everyone as a whole. For example, if you were a presidential candidate would you spend more time trying to sway California, with its whopping 55 electoral votes, or montana, with a teeny tiny 3 electoral votes? The candidates are not being considerate of ALL the American citizens, but instead the ones that they think will lead them to victory. This is not what the election is all about. The election is more focused on the popular vote of few states with many inhabitants than it is on many states with few citizens.

"Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." As stated in "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong" . Being that this true, why do we call it the "Presidential Election" instead of the "Electors Election?" Electors claim to be faithful to their candidates but sometimes this is not the case. If a member of the group is unfaithful to their candidate, it could unsettle the whole election, meaning that the United States as a whole would have to pay for the electors actions. This is not how voting was meant to be. Our slogan is "We the People," not "We the Electors." Now, I know what you're thinking, "Why would we change this system? It is already established and has worked for many years." In order to move forward as a nation we as a whole need to make changes sometimes. Just think what it would be like today if segregationan established rule and law was not questioned. Or even if the settlers of the United States had not questioned our former mother country and broke away. We would not even be the establishment we are today if we did not question established rules or traditions. The Electoral College is nothing more than a system that needs to be reevaluated, putting the popularity if the candidate in clearer perspective.

To recap, The Electoral College does not include the popularity of the candidates over official influences. The states are not being counted equally and electors control the electon overall. In order to have a more successful government and a more included population, the Electoral College simply needs to be reevaluated and changed to meet the popularity standards of our country if we are to ever advance.

The electoral college is a process that supposedly helps keep this nation's voting under control, while infact the process of the electoral college is unfair to the states with a lower population because they have less of an input into the voting of the president with a lower number of electors available to vote for them. Also it is unfair to the people who want to be presidents because they mostly have a tie on the electoral votes and are elected on who wins the popular vote.

First off, having an electoral college in unfair to those states of lower population, take Minnesota for example, because they are only allowed 36 electors while bigger states, like California, are allowed up to 55 electors, In defense of the Electoral College: Map . Since most of the big states already have their votes planned out on who is going to win them over, presidenttobe's don't try to persuade them because they know they have those votes. Mostly they try to change the swing states, or the smaller states because they could change from Democratic to Republican during anytime in the election. If everyone had a say in the election, more people would be inclined to vote and there would be more input into who became the next 4 year leader of this nation.

Second of all, electoral colleges should change because for the last two elections, popular vote has been the deciding vote because the electoral vote has been a tie, In defense of the Electoral College: 2 Everyone's President.If we no longer polled electoral votes, citizens wouldn't have to take two votes, one on presidency and one on who they liked better. Presidents should be chosen on their stamina to change the nation for the people. Although some people still won't get what they want, the majority of the nation would be proud to support eachother in any of the changes the president makes.

In the world that is known, electoral colleges do make voting for the president a lot more controlled. But in the event that the elector is chosen and does not vote for whom he or she was elected by the people to vote for. What happens then? The wrong president is chosen because there was a fault in the system. This is called the disaster factor and it happened in the election in the year 1960 when Louisiana elected Democrats to vote against John F. Kennedy, who voted as Republicans against their state and voted forPresident Kennedy, The Indefensible Electoral College: What's wrong with the Electoral College.

After all, electoral colleges should be changed because it is better for the people so there is more of an input from smaller populated states, they will want to vote and there would be less of an ability to tie the election. Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already "chosen" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not least, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrongdoings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.

The Electoral College is a process that has been used for presidential elections since the Founding Fathers established it in the constitution. This system does not necessary give the voters a direct vote, but rather a vote for a slate of electors that vote for them. The voters entrust that their elected slate will vote for their favored presidential candidate. It brings up the argument whether this system of voting should be changed or kept. The Electoral College has some of its good points, but over all, it needs to be changed. Voters need a direct say in their vote, and this system turns off the interest of potential voters.

The voters of the United states should have the ability to directly vote for who they want as President. After all, the people are what make up the country and should have say. "It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational," says Bradford Plumer in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.

This means that the Electoral College is unfair to the people because the slate they vote for might not even vote for their candidate. Also, in the same article, Plumer states, "Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people." This means that there is a chance that the electors could vote for whoever they please.

This system of voting does not give the voters a direct say as to who they want, but also turns off the interest of voters who should be voting for their country. "Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know that have no chance of winning..." as said by Plumer. People within those states would have no motivation to vote for their president because their potienial president did not come to their state to convince them to vote. The candidates are only focused on getting majority of the electoral votes, and not who the people really want. "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets ddin't get to see a single campaign ad," Plumer had stated. These states lack any information about the potential ruler of their country just because the candidates are focused on the states that will help them win.

Although "each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for a party's nominee," as said by Richard A. Posner in In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , the possibility of having a winner based on electoral vote and not popular vote is very much possible. For instance, the 2000 election, Gore had won popular vote but due to the electoral vote, Bush had won the election. Gore won the vote for the most popular all over the nation, but because the electoral college had a majority of Bush, it was like the nation's actual vote did not matter.

The Electoral College is unfair to the people because they do not get a direct say for who they want, and the candidates only focus on states that will help them win based on electoral vote. The people need a say exactly who they want and should not depend on others to do the vote for them. Canidates should not only appeal to states that would make them win, but also to other states so the whole nation knows exactly who might be ruling over their country.

"My fellow americans," a phrase said by many important people, like current president Barack Obama, implicates that the speaker is trying to portray a message. So I use that phrase for a reason, "My fellow americans, there has been a current movement to limit the amount of time a person spends driving." There are many advantages to limiting car use, that could make a big difference in the amount of greenhouse gases.

Take Vauban, Germany for example, a neighborhood where 70 percent of its residents do not own a car. This neighborhood follows a growing trend across the world, and is flourishing. Source 1 states, "In the United States, the environmental Protection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously." This statement is a perfect example of this growing trend. If many suburbs follow vaughn's example, then the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere will plummet. This will then cause the ozone to repair itself and global warming can be stopped. Source 1 also states, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States." This statistic is shocking! If the United States is responsible for a majority of the greenhouse emissions, then why has the United states done nothing to fix this. This is not the only example of this growing trend.

Another example is Paris in 2014. Due to the abundance of smog in the air, Paris banned driving cars for a limited amount of time. This fixed their problem, but Paris removed the ban after only one week. Source 2 states, "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday." Why would France stop the solution to their smog problem. The answer is, loss of revenue. Many companies during this ban lost revenue due to not being able to deliver their goods. Source 2 also states, "Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe." This is a key factor in France's smog problem, and could be stopped by making a law limiting car usage.

One influential example is Bogota, Columbia. The citizens of Bogota have a tradition called "the Day Without Cars." They have been honoring this tradition for three years straight, and other countries around them are starting to take notice of its effects. Source 3 states, "For the first time, two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event." This statement shows how much of a pressing matter smog is to normal ppeople around the world. Source 3 also states, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." A day without cars not only helps the enviroment, it also mentally helps a person. If this could lower stress world wide, then less people would suffer from stress related injuries. Source 3 states, "... and new restaurantsd and upscale shopping districts have croped up." This tradition also helps the economy and can lower the percentage of people under the poverty line by creating jobs and helping people start their own business.

Three examples of cities or countries that have, at one time, stopped the usage of cars were shown in this essay. If all of the benefits from limting car use, like strengthening the economy, are true, then why has the world not caught on to this idea and helped it flourish. This essay has shown the benefits of limiting car use, but it is up to you to make a difference.

It'd be better to stay with the Electoral College when it comes to voting for the president. They try to evenly distribute the votes with every state, they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. Overall the Electoral College tries to keeps things fair for everyone. The Electoral College so far hasn't made a big mistake or elect a horrible president, so there's no need to mess with the voting system. Without the Electoral College, California would have the most votes put in to elect a president.

If there was no Electoral College all these little states like Rhode Island would have a hard time since their votes are rational compared to the big states like California. Richard A. Posner states "other things being equal, a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does" which makes things fair for everyone in small states or large states. The one big problem with the Electoral College voting is that there's only 538 of them while the United States consists of over 300 million citizens which makes almost all of the U.S. not voting for their president but instead for the people who vote for them.

Even though that is a pretty big problem, it does help keeps things fair when it comes to the favor of one candidate over the other. With the Electoral College, candidates that come from a certain region like the South aren't praised over more than a candidate from the North. If it were up to the citizens to choose, there'd be favor for candidates from different regions that represent them. Paragraph 19 says, "a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"Posner,19. The same paragraph brings out that no region has enough votes from the Electoral College to elect a president.

Within the Electoral College are people who are better suited to make the huge decision about who gets elected as president. If it were up to anyone to vote, then the whole system would be messed up. The Electoral College has electors who don't focus on candidates from their region or appearances but they focus on who they think would be able to run this nation the best. Even in most cases, the candidate with the more popular vote still wins. Along with that, the Electoral College tries to keep the electoral votes from being too close for disputes and ties.

So overall the Electoral College is better for the people when voting for president. They try to evenly distribute the votes with each state,they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. With the Electoral College, they try to keep things fair for everyone so that we can all be happy.

This essay will analyze, discuss and prove one reason in favor of keeping the Electoral College in the United States for its presidential elections. One of the reasons to keep the electoral college is that it is better for smaller, more rural states to have more influence as opposed to larger metropolitan areas that have large populations. The electors from these states are granted two votes each. Those from larger, more populated areas are granted just one vote each. Smaller states tend to hold significant power because their two votes for president and vice president add up more than the votes of larger states that have many electors. This is because of the split of the electoral votes. Some argue that electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes nationally. They do not have to vote for their own state's nominee unless their state has a winner take all system. However, there are states that have adopted laws that force their electors to vote for their state's candidate. It seems that, no matter how, electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most nationally. This is not always the case because of state legislatures who can overrule the electors and vote for the alternative candidate their citizens have selected for them, even if the voter lives in a state without a winner take all system.

Cars are a very big part of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.

Dear State Senator, Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country our President and Vice President. We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights. I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices.

The Electoral College has major flaws. Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions. Source A in paragraph 12 states, "In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way." The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly. The other countries would take us as a joke we would simply look like fools. Another thing is, what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote. Source B also in paragraph 12 says, "Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote." And with that being said, the election would be taken to the HOR House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. And because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing only 500,000 voters, would have much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million. That is the same population as Wyoming only times 70. That is a tremendous difference in population. Don't let our country plummet into bad election. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

Ever since our founding fathers have settled here in America and made the Decloration of Independence in the late 1700s, the Amendments, and everything that gives us the right to be free, the people have had the right to vote. With the Electoral College, the people of America will not be able to freely use that right. Source C says, "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing only on the right races in the "swing" states." Seventeen states didn't even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000. Those states including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see not one, not two, but zero campaign ads. Just as Source D states, "The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse." The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people. What if a state sends two state of electors to Congress? It happened in 1960 with Hawaii and luckily VP Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so "without establishing a precedent." What if it happened again? Remember when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush? Thank that to the electoral college. In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes that George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. But why?

First of all, Source E states, "So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does." But the problem with this is is that it's simply unfair. The smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do. This is like saying that on the baseball field, the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids don't get to play. It is not fair to the people in the smaller states like Wyoming, to be considered not as good as the state of California. Also in paragraph 20 of Source F says, "They are the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election." Once again, this statement is unfair. This is favoritism. This is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more "thoughtful". Once again, people deserve to have their rights so I say, let them vote.

People want to make their own decisions. It's who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities we want to feel important. With the electoral college we won't be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren't important enough to vote. So it's official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there's a pretty good reason. It's fair. There's only one thing I have to say to you. State Senator, please abolish the electoral college.

When were voting for president were not technically voting for the president in fact we are voting for the slate of electors. The electors can be anyone without a public holding office. Electoral college process is not a good process for presidency. While a president can get the majority of the popular vote on the other hand, he could have the minority of the electoral college votes. That president would lose the election even though he technically had the most votes. We should change the process into popular votes for the president.

The electoral college can or will defy the will of the people. The article "The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted ,Back in 1960,segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jhon F. Kennedy.So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.The election whould have gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college are way too risky to take on. just simply couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election.

The electoral college is a unfair process because of the winnertakeall system. In the article called What Is The Electoral College", by the office of the federal register it quoted most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article "The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.

In conclusion,The electoral college is a unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular vote. Obviously popular votes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winnertakes it all process counterfits the number of american citizens voting result. Eletoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits. Electoral college should be change and alter in to a different process with clean votes that'll actually be fair for once.

Changing our ways on how we use cars for the better? Is it just so happen that people are using there car less than usual? In many places like Germany, Paris, Bogota are changing the ways to use cars. To reduce every little problem cars are causing. Traffic jams, smogs, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, people are getting smart about using there cars everyday. Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.

When people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certain places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? You would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are actually happy that they put this new type of law. Many people preferred to have this happen.

Smogs? what are smogs? smogs are grey clouds that hurt is in ways we dont even know. Cars emmit these deadly gases and we dont know it. Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help reduce this problem. On mondays motorists with evennumbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.

Places like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." Many sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end. Cars sales have drop alot. People are taking the bus, taxis, and even trains to avoid traffic. "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn." Younges ages don't even drive till the age of 21 or they don't even care till then. They can usually care poll to places like partys, mall and the beach. They don't need a seperate car for each person when they are all going to the same place. Which is feel its a good and bad things. Its good because poeple are caring more that were causing harm to our own home and that they know that they can do all they want together and still have fun. It causes harm to busineses many stores could go out of business.

It does not matter if we try to stop using cars or not we are always hurting in some other way. Traffic jams, smogs and reducing greenhouse emissions are just the begining of this all. We can do way more if we put out mind set to it.

"Brazilian coffee, renowned worldwide, is an integral part of Brazil's cultural and economic fabric. As the largest coffee producer globally, Brazil has shaped the global coffee industry, influencing how coffee is grown, harvested, and enjoyed worldwide. The country's vast size and variety of climates make it uniquely suited for coffee cultivation, allowing for a wide range of flavors and profiles in Brazilian coffee.

Brazil's coffee is known for its smooth, nutty, and often chocolatey flavor profile, with low acidity and a full-bodied nature. These characteristics make it highly desirable for both single-origin brews and as a crucial component in coffee blends. Brazilian coffee beans, primarily of the Arabica variety, are grown in several regions, each imparting its unique terroir to the beans. The states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Espírito Santo are among the most prominent coffee-producing areas, each offering distinct flavors and qualities in their coffee.

The harvesting process in Brazil also plays a significant role in defining the coffee's characteristics. The country is known for its mechanized approach to harvesting due to the vast plantations, which contrasts with the hand-picking methods used in many other coffee-producing countries. This mechanization is a testament to Brazil's efficiency and innovation in coffee production.

Brazilian coffee is not only a major export commodity but also a point of national pride. Coffee is deeply ingrained in Brazilian culture, with the country having a vibrant café culture. Cafés are social hubs where people of all ages gather to enjoy a cup of coffee, often served as a small, strong espresso, reflecting the Brazilian preference for a concentrated and robust flavor.

In conclusion, Brazilian coffee is much more than a beverage; it's a symbol of Brazilian hospitality, culture, and innovation. Its rich, smooth flavor profiles and the country's dominance in global production make Brazilian coffee a staple for coffee lovers and a vital part of Brazil's national identity."

"The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved rapidly, influencing diverse aspects of society. From automated systems in transportation to intelligent personal assistants in our smartphones, AI technologies continue to shape the way we live and work.

In this essay, we will explore the current state of AI, its applications in different fields, and the ethical considerations associated with its widespread adoption. While AI offers immense potential for positive change, it also raises concerns about privacy, bias, and the impact on employment.

One prominent area where AI has made significant strides is in healthcare. AI algorithms can analyze medical data, assist in diagnostics, and predict patient outcomes. This has the potential to enhance medical decision-making, improve treatment outcomes, and contribute to personalized medicine. However, the integration of AI in healthcare requires careful consideration of data privacy, security, and ethical standards.

AI's influence extends to the business world, where automation and machine learning algorithms streamline processes and enhance efficiency. From customer service chatbots to predictive analytics in finance, businesses are leveraging AI to gain a competitive edge. Despite the benefits, ethical concerns arise regarding the potential misuse of AI for surveillance, discrimination, and the concentration of power in the hands of a few.

The development of autonomous vehicles represents another frontier for AI. While promising safer and more efficient transportation, the deployment of self-driving cars raises ethical dilemmas related to decision-making in critical situations. Determining the ethical guidelines for AI systems in such scenarios is crucial for ensuring public trust and safety.

In conclusion, the evolving landscape of AI presents both opportunities and challenges for society. Embracing the potential benefits requires addressing ethical considerations, fostering transparency, and implementing regulations that safeguard individual rights. As we navigate the integration of AI into various aspects of our lives, a thoughtful and ethical approach is essential for harnessing its transformative power responsibly."

The extensive use of car transportation is setting a cloud over our society, literally. Car transportation is so heavily depended on in the current generation that people don't realize the negatives it has on our environment, local businesses, and people's lives in general. transportation is not a priority and there are numerous advantages to gain out of limiting the use of cars the smog percentages in the atmosphere will decline and create an everlasting clear environment and magnificent clarity built skies, local businesses that are run by families in suburbs will see their popularity rising back up to their previous points before malls in distant areas took over, the stress of supporting a cars expenses will be relieved, and people will realize that we connect just as well through the internet rather than driving to meet friends.

Although cars are used by a vast amount of the population, the impact it has on the environment is withoutadoubt an ongoing situation that needs to be taken care of. The author states in the passage that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. That should automatically tell you that these vehicles are putting an impact on our environment. Limiting the permission that citizens have of using their cars temporarily has shown a massive decrease in the smog build up that takes up a rather large percentage in most cities, in source 2, paragraph 12 the author states the outcome of Paris permitting drivers with evennumbered licenses from driving this saw smog levels clear up enough to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. If only temporarily holding people back from driving can affect our environment so positively, imagine what the output would be if the world repeated this action on a much larger scale.

Furthermore, cars promote the popularity of malls, which takes away the attention from numerous local businesses. These local stores are ran by families that need customers to keep their system alive, and if cars are traveling a further distance to reach malls, it just takes away the money needed by these local businesses. Living in small communities and suburbs is a great solution to this problem and has proven to work already, for instance The suburb of Vauban, Germany stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant high way.

Another advantage of limititing car usage would be the lessening of stress, so many people have the burden of paying expensive car bills and having to work more than one job just to keep up with the numerous payments cars require, accidents are also caused by the massive amount of cars that are already in use on the roads. If people would carpool more often or take public transporations such as buses and trains, we would see an immense improvement of families income and we'd expect a safer society as a whole, safer from the hazards caused by the humongous majority of vehicle transportation. Having a car isn't a priority, working a job close to home and using bus transportation will be benfitial to your community, just plan out your approach and you'll soon understand why having a car isn't always necessary.

All in all, putting a stop to the extensive of cars will mainly bring out the pros, people always say they want to see the world become less polluted and free from toxic gases, limiting car usage is the first step to achieving this goal as we'd see smog in our skies clear out, your local businesses can step back into popularity and connect your community even more rather than traveling a far distance to reach malls. And finally, one of the main advantages would be the effect is has on you. All your money stresses will be relieved and you'll be able to focus on something more important than a car bill. The world is noticing these possibilities and we are heading for a chage on step at a time.

"The cuisine of the United States is as diverse as its history, reflecting the melting pot of cultures that have shaped the nation. American food is known for its bold flavors, large portions, and unique regional variations, making it a fascinating landscape for culinary exploration.

One of the defining characteristics of American cuisine is its regional diversity. In the South, for example, you'll find comfort foods like fried chicken, barbecue ribs, and cornbread, often accompanied by sweet tea. These dishes reflect the region's agricultural history and its blend of African, French, and Spanish influences. The Northeast, particularly New England, is renowned for its seafood, with dishes like clam chowder and lobster rolls being regional specialties.

Another hallmark of American cuisine is its innovation and willingness to adapt and evolve. Fast food, a concept that originated in the U.S., has transformed the global culinary landscape. Burgers, hot dogs, and pizzas, while having roots elsewhere, have been adopted and adapted into quintessentially American dishes, often served with a side of fries and a soft drink.

The U.S. is also known for its diner culture, offering a range of comfort foods like pancakes, milkshakes, and club sandwiches. These establishments, often open 24/7, are a testament to the country's fast-paced lifestyle and its love for hearty, comforting meals.

Moreover, the U.S. has a flourishing food scene that embraces international cuisines. Cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago offer everything from authentic Italian pasta to Mexican tacos, showcasing the country's diverse population and its openness to different flavors and ingredients.

In conclusion, American cuisine is a reflection of the country's rich cultural tapestry. It's a cuisine that's constantly evolving, unafraid to blend traditions and innovate, resulting in a food culture that's vibrant, diverse, and unmistakably American."

Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save money. Also due to many different reasons, even if it's for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it's China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minimize pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren't the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are.

In Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. "Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park" Rosenthal 2 but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. "Carowners can buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home." Rosenthal 2 That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article " In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars " by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of vaughn's Families don't even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn't that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don't have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely.

Due to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a "partial driving ban to clear the air or global city" Duffer 10. For example, in this article called " " by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be 31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn't produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn't have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn't really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about "4,000 drivers were fined," and "27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine" Duffer 12. Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that "Congestion was down 60 percent" Duffer 14. The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough.

Bogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. " Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota " by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia.

For a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of "7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines." Selsky 21 Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has "118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City." Selsky 27 One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries.

Yet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called " ", is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. "Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." Rosenthal 29 The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, "Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions" Rosenthal 29. New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It's already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn't there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be.

To wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air unless it's a hybrid. The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages.

arguments on whether the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States are occurring today. Each favor has its advantages and disadvantages, but we should favor in keeping the Electoral College. This is because less disputes are likely to happen and not voting will not effect the election.

On the other hand, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States has some advantages. In "Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", author Bradford Plumer claims "the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" because "candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning." This means that the candidates focus on the "tight races of the swing states." To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote counthowever, changing to election by popular vote will cause many disputes and it is not the right way to keep everyone satisfied with voting for a new president. Keeping the Electoral College is more realistic.

To begin, the Electoral College is fair to the states, leaving fewer disputes. In "Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College "restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution." The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with "the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election." To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will receive the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.

In addition, the Electoral College method does not get affected by the ones who chose not to vote. In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President", author Richard A. Posner states that "knowing the voters vote has no effect gives them less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign." But, "voters in presidential electons are people who want to express political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election." This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever.

To conclude, the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College rather than changing to election be popular vote for the president of the United States because less disputes will occur and not participating will not be effective.

These bottles, often made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), have become a symbol of modern society's reliance on disposable products. While they offer the convenience of portable and safe drinking water, their widespread use has led to serious environmental concerns.

One of the primary advantages of plastic water bottles is their convenience. Lightweight and durable, they are an easy solution for staying hydrated on the go, especially in areas where access to clean water is limited. The bottled water industry has grown rapidly, with marketing often emphasizing health and purity – a persuasive selling point in an era increasingly focused on wellness.

However, the environmental impact of these bottles is significant. The production process is resource-intensive, requiring large amounts of water and fossil fuels. Moreover, plastic water bottles contribute to the growing problem of plastic pollution. Despite recycling efforts, a vast majority of these bottles end up in landfills or as litter in natural environments, where they can take hundreds of years to decompose. This pollution harms wildlife, disrupts ecosystems, and contributes to the increasing problem of microplastics in our oceans.

In response to these environmental concerns, there is a growing movement towards more sustainable practices. This includes increased use of reusable water bottles made from sustainable materials, improved recycling programs, and efforts by companies to develop more eco-friendly packaging solutions. Additionally, there is a push for better access to safe, clean tap water to reduce reliance on bottled water.

In conclusion, while plastic water bottles offer convenience, their environmental impact cannot be overlooked. The challenge lies in balancing the need for accessible hydration with the imperative of protecting our planet, prompting both individuals and industries to consider more sustainable practices in their daily lives."

Dear Senator, The electoral college was a perfect way of electing, in the 1900's. Now, we should be allowing the people of the United States decide who they want to be their president. Not only is this inequality, but it is deceiving and unfair. I know people say "Life's unfair." and while it is, we should be doing our best to keep our country in line. We are already in a steep pile of debt. Obama has only made this worse. Why was he elected? Mostly because he is part of a minority. Inequality much?

U.S. citizens are being put to shame by every elector in the electoral college. We have the right to vote, for electors. And these electors barely ever follow suit. Not only do they stray from what the people want, they also take away our authority in the government. If we have the right to vote, then let us vote on wether or not to keep the electoral college. I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one who has these thoughts. I understand that I am simply a child and that you have no reason to listen to me, but if not me, listen to the rest of our country.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

passage 2, paragraph 10 As stated by Bradford Plumer, we do not elect our president. If we did, Al Gore would have been our president in 2000. If all men are equal, then why are you choosing certain people over the U.S. population. It is utterly deceiving to take our votes and throw them away, to make us think that our votes matter when they really don't. If this is who you want to choose our president, then don't have us vote.

Although people say that the electoral college takes away the chance of majority, that's how the system works. How do you think the president wins? They like to call it winnertakesall. That is a nice way to put it. The president is decided by the majority of votes in the electoral college. What puts these electors above me? I am young, but I have a working mind just like my parents. Why do my parents votes get pushed to the side and ignored? The reason is because the U.S. is a lying and unfair country. They tell us that we are the ones who control the government, yet they put our own people above us.

America has been going downhill and that is all that will continue if we dont change something. Getting rid of the electoral college will allow us to prosper. Why listen to a young teenager? Well, I know how it feels to be put on the bottom of the ladder, even if you are the smartest. America knows what is best for us. Not a few people chosen in each state to represent what they themselves want. Let us choose the president once, and if it doesn't work out, then you can continue your way. Just remember, if you never shoot for the moon, you will never reach the stars.

Limiting car use causes pollution, increases costs to users regardless of where services or services are offered. Furthermore, over use of the gas results in increased environmental degradation, harming our resources while damaging our environment.

When consumers pay a larger amount before gasoline is refined then there are higher costs of running the engine than otherwise. There are fewer places where the gas can be purchased locally causing more problems. Car trips will usually have higher tolls which results in lost wages for the transportation worker, who goes to an unnecessary location for work and then returns home and gets to pay back his transportation back costs. The car accident rate amongst children also has increased. Car pollution can become airborne easily, contaminating children's health. Also children tend to be more careless and more often in accidents simply because of being pushed out of their cars onto the road. All of this can be done to better an already polluted Earth that is becoming increasingly damaged at a much faster rate. Limiting our vehicle use helps our citizens with a reduced budget. It also reduces pollution for local areas. Furthermore, it improves public health and makes city dwellers a wealthier society.

Limiting our own usage by adopting public transportation, walking, biking, and public transport actually would be beneficial for the citizens and planet. I think its very healthy but very little others show similar sentiment mostly environmental activists who want a more environmentally clean place so it often is still looked down upon it still will bring about a very drastic price eventually but there will never be carbon credit trading or an oil recycling scheme unless people want it too. Limiting car use is good for the city.

Think about how many times a week we get in a car to drive somewhere. I know I drive to school, to lacrosse practice, and to spend time with friends on a weekly basis. Some people may claim that driving is a positive aspect of our culture because it allows us to get from one place to another and accomplish tasks in a timely fashion, but driving in excess has some serious consequences. Although some may argue that it is impossible to completely cut out an action that is essential to our daily lives, and that cutting down on driving would not be advantageous, limiting the amount of time we spend driving has many advantages. Cutting down on automobile use will decrease pollution in our air, and make us healthier and happier, which is why many legislators and cities are reducing automobile use.

Beijing, China, is the most polluted city in the world according to Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune in 2014. source 2 paragraph 14 This is due to the fact that being's automobile use is extremely high. When the city of Paris was faced with a similar crisis, it issued a partial driving ban that allowed people to only drive on days that the government said they could in accordance to their licence plate number, or they would face a fine. source 2 paragraph 1019. This revolutionary ban caused the air pollution in Paris to drop so much that the ban was lifted after only one day. The drop in air pollution clearly refutes the claim that cutting down on driving is not advantageous. Cutting down on automobile use is beneficial to the environment because, according to Elizabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times in 2009 source 1 paragraph 5, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States." Limiting automobile use is crucial to cleaning our air and stopping the burning of fossil fuels, thus explains why is beneficial to limit our car use.

Although some might argue that driving a car to work is easier, evidence shows that people who limit their car use are happier and healthier. Rosenthal writes about the city of Vauban, Germany, where "70% of vaughn's families do not own a car." source 1 paragraph 3 Heidrum Walter, a carless citizen from Vauban, states that, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." source 1 paragraph 3 The concept of people being happier and healthier without cars is further proved in Bogota, Columbia, where, according to Andrew Selsky of the Seattle Times in 2002, "For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million." source 3 paragraph 21 Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, "It's a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"as he rode his bike with his wife. The statements from Walter of Vauban and Plaza of Bogota show how limiting automobile use is advantageous to the overall wellbeing and happiness of people, thus we should limit our automotive use.

Limiting automobile use is so beneficial, that many groups and legislators are supporting a society with less cars. The EPA in the United States is promoting "car reduced" communities, and legislators are starting to act. source 1 paragraph 9 David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, states that, "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change." Sociology proffesor at Drecel University, Mimi Sheller, further elaborates, stating, "Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift." source 4 paragraph 35 The support for a "car reduced" society by the US government and the EPA is the cherry on top to all of the benefits associated with driving less, thus we should limit our automobile use.

Society is changing. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. source 4 paragraph 41 Now is the time to turn off the engine, get out of the car, and take a bus, bike, or train to work. By limiting our automobile use, we keep our air clean by burning less fossil fuels, and we are happier and healthier, which is why organizations like the EPA support the reduction of car use. We need to act today to save the next generation of citizens from ecological destruction. The benefits of reducing car use are countless, which explains why we should limit our automobile use.

Many cities are experiencing perhaps the biggest economic change being implemented into society since the invention of the Model T. People just simply aren't interested in attaining a personal vehicle, or even a license for that matter. As a result, many personal vehicle companies are starting to become more "mobile" to stay with the times, or become bankrupt due to being stagnant in sales. Not owning a car has actually proved to come with more advantages than if owning a car. Such as, less carbon emissions in the air, less stress in certain communities where carfree zones are being implemented, and finally restaurants and stores becoming more "cropped up" due to rushhour restrictions essentially boosting the economy.

The lack of car use has fundamentally benefitted the environment as an entirety. Cars emit carbon emissions into the air that are not only harmful to many animals, but to humans as well. According to Source 2, in Paris, France alone, it was shown that "due to the use of diesel fuel over regular fuel, there were 147 micrograms of particle matter per cubic meter." Comparing this to other major cities in Europe that find more use for regular gasoline, you'll find that the results are less. In Brussels, there were 114 micrograms of PM per cubic meter, and in London, 79.7. Even though areas that used more regular fuel over diesel fuel were significantly lower in micrograms of particle matter, even 79.7 micrograms can be potentially fatal, and cause lungrelated health problems in the later lives of the people occupying these areas. Officials not only in Paris, but also in major cities such as Bogota, Colombia and New York City, New York have also began to take a stand. In Paris, France for example, "there are certain days in which cars cannot be driven by people with license plates ending in even numbers, and the next day by people with license plates ending in odd numbers. This new way of thinking has been implemented into the French law system to help decrease the amount of pollution in the air." Source 2 Bogota has also found a unique approach to a less polluted environment. "Carfree day is a day in which no cars are driven, with the exception of buses and taxis." Source 3 Finally, New York City has implemented a "new bikesharing program in which bicycles can be rented for a costeffective amount. In addition to this, bridge and tunnel tolls have also reflected these new priorities by skyrocketing in price." Source 4 These new implementations have proved beneficial in decreasing the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Many communities have not only found a way to reduce pollution in the air, but also live a more stressfree lifestyle.

Stress and rushhour are known to have some corollation, but newer communities are starting to take a stand by limiting the amount of car usage in their area. Vauban, Germany, a newer community only just established in 2006, is an example of one of these communities that has started to "smart plan." Over 70 percent of Vauban's occupants don't own a car, and 57 percent have sold a car to move there." Source 1 A happier lifestyle has appeared as a result. According to Heidrun Walter, an occupant in Vauban. When she had a car, she was always "tense." But now, she's a much happier mother of two, and the distant hum of an occasional motor vehicle is drowned out by the "chattering of wandering children." Source 1 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA is suggesting that we start implementing these "car reduced" communities in our nation to better society, as well as to provide a more stressfree environment for these new communities' residents. Source 1 Even in Bogota, people have said that the use of no cars is a "great opportunity that has taken away stress and lowered air pollution." Source 3 Not only has pollution been reduced in all of this or the fact that a factor attributing to stress has also been removed, but areas where these communities are starting to form, have also boosted the economy. In Bogota, it has been reported that due to Carfree day, that both "parks and sports centers have started to appear throughout the city. In additon to this, sidewalks have been replaced by more broad, smooth sidewalks. As well as, rushhour traffic has been cut, allowing new restaurants and upscale shopping districts to flourish." Source 3 "Cars are starting to become a thing of the past," according to Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. Even her children 19 and 21 don't have licenses. "They say they're interested, but it's not a priority for them," she later goes on to say. As a result, gas money is saved, and people can spend more money on things that matter to them.

In conclusion, it has been displayed that the advantages of not using a car are starting to outweight the benefits. The lack of car use in these carfree communities is helping to reduce stress and tension on the road, boost not only the community's economy, but also the entire nation's economy as well. In addition to this, the lack of car use is also helping to preserve the environment, by reducing carbon emissions into the air. According to many sociologists and business professionals, the downfall of the car may well be on its way, but it may not be such a bad thing.

The debate on the pros and cons of car usage has been an ongoing one. Slowly, the advantages are beginning to outweigh the disadvantages. Around the world, projects and programs have been started to test the effects of limited car use. Data has proved that limiting car usage will cause less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.

To begin with, gas released from our cars has slowly started to hurt us. "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."source 2. This shows that the gas in our cars is one of the factors responsible for the growing pollution in our air. Reducing the usage of cars will not only benefit us, but also the world we live in.

In addition, almost everyone knows what it is like to be stuck in traffic. The stress inducing event must not be healthy either. By declining the use of cars, congestion will slowly diminish. Promoting other ways of transportation will improve health, mood, and traffic. "rushhour restrictions have drastically cut traffic"source 3.

Furthermore, a large portion of our population are constantly stressed. Car usage is accountable for a good amount of it. "When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," source 1 says a citizen of a "carfree" community. By limiting car usage, healthier ways of transportation are encouraged. For example, hiking, biking, skating, and walking. All of these are extremely healthy compared to sitting in a car. Due to the fact that the United States is the country with the fattest people, these methods should be enforced. Healthy people then start to become happier. Therefore, reducing car usage will benefit our people's lives.

Hence, limiting car usage will create a better environment for people all around the world.

Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potentially become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go "down 60 percent... after fivedays of intensifying smog." This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. additionally, limiting car usage can push more people into exercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians "hiked, biked, skated..." during their carfree days source 3. Also, many "parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city" source 3. With an increase of exercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.

furthermore, lowering car usage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a carowner may "buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home source 1." Normally, a decent size house is approximately 100,000 to 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said "I'm much happier this way source 1," because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stressfree lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.

The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow.

Cars most people use them for transportation. It's our lazy way of getting to places.

Automobiles benefit us plenty when it comes to getting from point A to point B, but they also have a big negative impact. Cars are responsible for a huge amount of pollution like greenhouse gas emissions and smog. If we were to limit car usage, we could decrease the amount of stress and pollution emitted into the air, as well as give our community a chance to improve.

In Vauban, Germany, residents have given up their cars and have no problem doing so. Cars are generally not allowed, forbidden some would say, in this district. vaughn's streets are pretty much "carfree". Of course car ownership is still allowed, with the exception that you have to be able to find a place to park since there are only two places large garages at the end of the development, where a carowner can buy a space for 40,000, along with a home. "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way," Heidrun Walter stated, a mother of two. Experts say automobiles are a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Paris participated in a driving ban, which violators suffered a fine of 22euro31. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, for example, last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter while Brussels had 114 PM and 79.7 PM in London. Since Paris participated in this ban, 60 percent of Paris' smog has cleared.

In Bogota, Columbia, the city held a carfree day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third year in a row cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted to this Day Without Cars. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog as well. Violators here faced 25 fines. Even with occasional bad weather, people still participated in this event. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man, as he rode a twoseated bicycle with his wife. The Day Without Cars allowed parks and sports centers to bloom, uneven sidewalks to be replaced wih broad smooth sidewalks, new restaurants and upscale shopping districs to crop up, and rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

In the United States, Americans are starting to buy fewer cars, drive less, and get fewer licenses as each year passes partially because cashstrapped Americans couldn't afford new cars. If this pattern continues, which many sociologists believe, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment. Even though reducing automobile transportation could have negative implications for car industries, the positive affects are much more important. In this generation, the internet allows people to connect without having to drive to meet friends. At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which "pedesrtian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety." In conclusion, cars are starting to be less and less of a neccesity, and more and more people are starting to notice that automobiles are just hurting the enviornment. By limiting car use, it can limit stress, help the enviornment as well as communities to improve, save time, conserve resources and improvee safety. There are plenty of other ways to get transportation that are less damaging and dangerous, like bicycles and walking. Of course it may take a little longer to get places without a car, but you can always ride a bus, or enjoy the scenery while riding a bike or walking.

Congestion, the amount of car traffic in a specific area, is significantly decreasing due to a new idea that has sprung:limiting car usage. Places such as Vauban, Paris, Bogota, Cali and Valledupar are participating in a program that's made to decrease car usage. Some of these cities enjoy Day Without Cars, a holiday that "promotes alternative transportation and reduces smog". Selsky 1 Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Limiting car usage promotes a healthier, cleaner environment for all. By using alternative transportation, such as buses, taxis, biking or even walking, the amount of greenhouse emission is drastically reduced. Rosenthal 1 The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States are encouraging "car reduced" communities, causing legislators to act. This will cut the amount of money spent yearly by U.S. citizens and the government as a whole, reducing the federal transportation bill. Rosenthal 1 Paris, too, momentarily banned driving due to smog. Paris enforced a driving ban that lasted a few days to clear the city's air after a close call to record pollution. Although some people were upset, congestion was down 60 percent, and the smog cleared a few days later. Duffer 1 All in all, diesel usage decreased, leaving a "greener" environment in its place.

President Obama has also wanted "to curb the United states greenhouse gas emissions," Rosenthal 1, he revealed last week. Although the United states rate of car ownership per person and per household has started to decrease, there are still more things that could be done to create a longterm cultural shift. Rosenthal 1 New York has recently created a bikesharing program that has done remarkably well. Many cities have proposed plans to make personal vehicle ownership impractical or undesirable. Rosenthal 1 Even Bill Ford, the owner of the Ford Car Company, suggested an idea to creat cities in which "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety," at the Mobile World Congress last year. Rosenthal 1 Bogota, Colombia specifically enjoys a yearly carfree day in which the only exception of vehicle transportation are buses and taxis. This prevents traffic jams, reduces air pollution, and cuts the many costs to cars. Even in rain, the event continued on "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Antanas Mockus, the Bogota Mayor. Selsky 1 Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asucnion, Paraguay, said that "these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders." Smog reduction, costcutting, stressrelieving and trafficjamfree, participating in this global change is an opportunity you won't want to miss.

There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Decreasing the amount of time citizens use personal motorvehicles positively impacts the environment and the state of mind of people. The lack of driving personal cars is becoming more widely accepted in several countries for different reasons. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, is an experimental district testing the lifestyle that does not use cars. Paris banned driving for environmental reasons, and Bogota decided to try it out too. Also, it is a trend in America for the purpose of saving money and because there are other convenient options.

The decrease in fumes from cars is very beneficial to the environment. People and organizations are making drastic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. According to paragraph five of "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," twelve percent of greenhouse gas in Europe is caused by passenger cars and fifty percent in some areas of the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities because emissions from cars contributes to half of the pollution in America. In the Article by Robert Duffer, "Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog" he describes the event that Paris had to declare a ban on half of the drivers because the large amount of smog that lingered over Paris. Colombia even has a day dedicated to being free of cars to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. All of these events show the severity of environmental problems caused by cars and people making efforts to promote a better environment.

Also, a decrease in personal motor vehicles causes people to have a better state of mind. Heidrun Walter states, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." With a car comes a lot of responsibility which leads to a lot of stress on a person. Not having a car is one less bill to pay and thing to take care of which for many people is a better way of living."It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," stated Carlos Arturo Plaza on carfree day in Bogota, Colombia. The car free day has also promoted other things to bloom in the city such as parks, sidewalks, and restaurants that people really enjoy. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article "The End of Car Culture," her children have other priorities than recieving their license because they have other things they would rather focus on that they enjoy more. All of these things promote people living a healthier and happier life.

Overall, limiting car usage is a "winwin" situation for everyone. Decreasing fumes and the stress of a car causes the environment and people to be happier. Promoting public trasportation or other ways of getting places is better for everyone. It is a growing trend all over the world, and for a good reason. A lack of fumes from cars will clear the air, and clear the minds of fellow citizens.

In today's world, many of us see cars as a necessary tool used to get us where we need to go in the shortest time possible. However, what many do not realize is how much restricting our usage of the personal automobile will actually help society in the long run. Decreasing our usage of the car will not only cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, but will also improve congestion and see an a boost in the economy of cities and countries around the world.

There is no doubt that cutting down on driving will greatly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. As detailed in "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, the effect of just one day of reduced driving played a significant impact on the amount of smog in Paris, France. The smog which covered the city of Paris rivaled that of Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cause of the intense fog is thought to be diesel fuel, which is the most commonly used type of automobile fuel in France. Because of this, Paris has a very high smog concentration compared to other Western European capitals. The temporary ban on driving drastically improved the conditions in Paris, and the ban was lifted after only one day. If this idea of reducing the use of automobiles spreader to other cardependent countries such as the U.S., there is no telling how much the impact of society on the emission of greenhouse gasses will reduce.

Additionally, the increasingly popular idea of favoring walking or biking over driving to one's destination has seemed to have a significant impact around the world. In the passage "Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky, the capital city of Bogota, Colombia has participated in the Day Without Cars program for three straight years. This has led to an increase in the creation of bicycle paths and cut down on congestion and traffic jams normally common in the city. In addition, the uprising of parks and recreation centers has also helped to boost the city's economy. However, this program has not been restricted to Bogota, as many people from countries around the world have come to see the event. This has the potential to become an internationally now phenomena, which will greatly improve the health and wellbeing of the people of the world. New bicycling opprotunities will mean no longer getting in traffic jams and will reduce stress and congestion in the long run.

In conclusion, the limiting of car usage would have a profound impact on our society, not only on pollution and the envorinment, but on our personal wellbeing. The limiting of our dependency on cars has had a great effect on the emission of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and smog has the potential to be removed from modern cities all together the economy would also benefit, as fewer cars means fewer roads needing to be built and an increase of bicycle trails, parks, and shopping centers in walking distance of neighborhoods. Overall, the limiting of car usage would have a fantastic impact on society and our world as a whole.

In the United States, the process to pick the president is rather complicated. From nationwide voting to states that swing from party to party, it has intricate parts that most people find confusing. The electoral college, the process that in the end picks the president, is also rather complicated. It was made to be a compromise of picking the president by votes in congress and popular vote from citizens by the founding fathers. In modern times however, most citizens agree that popular vote makes more sense and that the electoral college has become rather bloated. In the case of finding reasons of why the electoral college doesn't really work is because private citizens vote for someone else to vote and that voters from different states don't control who the electors choose.

First of all, because of the electoral college, citizen's vote counts less when they vote for someone else to vote. Most citizens would relish the chance to vote for the candidate that they choose to support. But when they do vote, their vote only just might sway the electors vote. For example, during the 2000 presidential election, instead of the intended candidate winning the vote, the electoral college choose another. It removes any sense of personal worth when participating in general elections and makes it harder for some candidates to win.

Furthermore, not only do electors choose the president, but the votes themselves from private citizens don't control who the electors choose. Electors are people chosen at state conventions, presidential candidates, and state party's central committees. The amount is chosen on the populations of such states, making smaller states with still a significant population seem insignificant. However, the biggest slight is that the votes made by the citizens don't obligate electors to choose what the general population has already choosen. It takes away control from the "people" and is inherently wrong.

In conclusion, the electoral college is rather useless because it does the job that citizens already do and takes away control from them. By voting for electors, the electoral college process takes away a sense of self in elections while giving the power to choose the president to a group of about 200 people that can be persuaded or just simply choosen by the candidates themselves. Its a bloated system and should be dealt with.

To get from point A to point B, whether it be from home to the park or from school to the movies, the logical answer that pops up in everyone's mind seems to be a car. automobiles such as cars and motorcycles are widely used and are integrated into every part of society. But do automobiles really need to be so rooted into everything people do as a society? Cars and motorcycles create a myriad of problems such as congestion and smog. Some societies even legally limit their community's automobile usage to attempt to correct some essential problems. Limiting automobile usage is important, because not only is it practiced globally with tremendous success, but it also largely reduces pollution caused by diesel fuel and brings to light issues within communities and accounts for their resolution.

Automobiles are thought of as a daily commodity in most urban countries, but there are some societies in which usage has been reduced or even eliminated entirely and the positive results may be shocking. In the suburban city Vauban, Germany, residents have given up automobiles for a chance at a life free of traffic sounds and stress. This experimental journey within the town has achieved these and so much more. Their streets are essentially carfree and the lack of garages and parking space allows for up to 5,500 people to live in a single rectangular square mile with any necessary stores within walking distance Source 1 Par 6. similarlyyet on a much smaller scale, Bogota, Columbia has initiated a carfree day in an attempt to eliminate the area's pollution as well as reduce stress. The day is on its third year and has done as hoped. Additionally, Bogota's once pitted and uneven sidewalks have been since replaced and made much smoother, and the city has introduced parks and sports centers, new restaurants, and new shopping centers which are blossoming and thriving Source 4 Par 28. these changes have created a society both happy and strongly bonded. As wonderful as these positive shifts in society are, limiting automobile usage can do even more.

A limit in automobile usage can also benefit communities by reducing pollutionseeing as a large majority of air pollution is created through the release of diesel fuels into the air. Paris, France legally banned personally automobile use throughout the city in order to rid the city's air of harsh pollutants Source 2 Par 10. France experiences a combination of cold nights and warm days that trap the emmisions from cars, scooters, and motorcycles Source 2 Par 15. By significantly reducing the amount of diesel fuels rising to the air to be trapped, the smog had cleared enough within mere weeks that the city was able to entirely lifted the ban. This is a major example of the advantages limiting car usage entails.

Altogether, limiting automobile usage is key to improving society and has myriad advantages such as creating a more bonded and pleasant community and reduces environmental hazards like pollution. Creating vehicular limits is a promising way to change the world as we know it for the better.

I strongly believe that the Electoral College should remain the way it is or, better yet, that we should elect the president by popular vote. This is due to the fact that the Electoral College does not accurately reflect the will of the people. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, an estimated two million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump however, Trump won the Electoral College vote, 304 to 232. This means that a candidate can win a majority of the Electoral College voters while losing the popular vote! Furthermore, voting for President should be an individual citizen decision, not a state decision. The Electoral College works by awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the winner of the majority of votes in the state. This means that a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not receive any of that states electoral votes. This goes against the concept of onepersononevote, since a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not win any electoral votes. By eliminating the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote, the votes of every individual will be counted, and the candidate who wins the most votes nationally will win the election. In conclusion, the Electoral College does not reflect the will of the people and votes in state are not equally weighted. It is time to elect the president by popular vote and to finally give the votes of individual citizens the weight they deserve.

All around the world, people are using gasgusling vehicles of mass destruction. Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the "CarFree Day" in Bogota, Colombia, and the partialdriving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeccessing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a longterm positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases is one of the common issues troubling countries worldwide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depletion of Earth's Ozone layer. According to Source 2: Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog, "The Smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world... Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found." The city of Paris had legislate, "On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day" . Resulting from their legislation, "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday" . Paris, originally one of the worlds' mostpolluted cities, decreased their pollution so much in one day that it was deemed unnecessary to continue the ban for the oddnumbered license plates the next day. "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States" Article 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . A decrease in these emissions could have significant effects, as witnessed in Paris. Also, a Local Colombian businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza claimed that the CarFree Day was "a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" Source 3: CarFree Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota . The government and their factions are in agreement that the ban on cars is only positive. Whether it is Colombia, Germany, or Paris, the restriction on drving was a major success. Imagine if more countries around the world opted to institute this ban there would be no energycrisis nor would there be as much of a pollution issue.

Along with the decrease in pollution, there would be a massive decrease in traffic. The vehicular limitations in the betacountries France, Colombia, and Germany have shown that the restrictions imposed decrease the amount of traffic significantly. Based on Source 3 , in Bogota, "... a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." Rather than having a holierthanthou complex, these Colombians supported the greater good of their country and ceased use of all cars on the carfree day. A positive domino affect occured in Colombia as well. According to Source 3 , "Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." These beta countries have improved the standard of living by meerely putting some restrictions on driving for brief periods of time. The United States has seen various changes as well. While there are no current driving restrictions, new priorities are being discovered, such as the bikesharing program in one of America's most heavily trafficed cities, New York. According to Source 4: The End of Car Culture , "New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a poliferation of carsharinf programs across the nation." Nations are beginning to catch on to the contagious cold of revolutionary alternatives to driving and traffic crises.

France, Germany, Colombia, and the United States are already seeing positive changes. The longterm culture shift is proving to be an aspiration for many countries. According to Source 4 , "The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of city centers has made the suburbs less appealing and has crawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work." People are becoming more connected through digital devices as societies become more technologically advanced, therefore the need for a large amount of privately owned cars has become moot. In Vauban, Germany, Heidran Walter, a media trainer and mother, claims, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" . Commoners, such as Mrs. Walter, are respoding positively to the laws of the experimental district of Vauban, which has very few areas and opportunities for cars. In fact, "70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here" . This modernday industrial revolution is drawing vast numbers of people into the areas inwhich cars have become a rarity.

Source 1 also states that "Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning"." The beta countries have had much success and have not seen failure yet. Although in France, "Almost 4,000 dricers were fined... Twentyseven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine" , it should not be considered a failed experiment. Of the millions of people who live in France, they only saw a small fraction of driving infractions on the day they limited driving. The longterm culture shift that the world is beginning to see is certainly moving in a positive direction.

Between ISIS and the iPhone, the world has come across a variety of both positive and negative circumstances. Considering all of the positive effects of limitations of cars, including but not limited to less traffic, a decrease in pollution, and longterm culture shifts, there have been many advantages to the switch to a carfree enviornment. Even though transportation may take longer, it will be safer and better for the enviornment. Not everyone country can guarantee that all of their citizens will abide by the new laws, as shown in France, but a small fraction of the trouble is better than the mass population of millions, and in some places billions, wrecking havoc on the planet.

Here, in the United States, birthplace of the Model T,driving has proven to be part of our history and culture. However, with recently uncovered developments in our environment such as global warming and pollution, it is time for us to reevaluate our "car culture". Overusage has proven harmful and limiting alternatives that reduce stress, are just as effective in getting us from point 'A' to 'B' and are more ecofriendly.

Our excessive car usage is dramatically hurting our environment. In fact, "...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States" 5. What people use for our short term convenience is actually proving inconvenient for us in the long run. In Paris, there was "147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London" 17. The culprit? Diesel fuel emissions from transportation cars. To underscore the severity, the smog in Paris is so bad that French Officials had to limit car usage in a smog cloaked city that "rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"14.

This issue is mirrored in Bogota, Columbia, where the government has also stepped in and established a car free day in which perpetrators get fined in order to " promote alternative transportation and reduce smog" 21. Efforts such as these can be effective in aiding our environmental crisis. After France also instate a limit on car usage "the smog cleared" 19. By limiting our car usage we can actually make a difference in reducing pollution and make our living environment more pleasant and healthier.

The switch is facilitated further not only by the inclination toward a better worldy environment but a less stressful social one as well. In the city of Vauban in Germany, residents have " given up their cars"1. Here although car ownership is allowed, "70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there." 3. Do the residents regret their decision? According to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two: "When I had a car I was always tense, I am much happier this way"3. In Bogota, a business man, Carlos Arturo Plaza who participates in Bogota's movement to reduce car usage says that the absence of cars is an "...opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" 24. These are two individuals on different continents with families and busy lives who find the lack of cars to be not a handicap but actually a source of stress relief. In France, after the restrictions of car usage the streets also became less stressful for people who have to drive like taxi drivers or public transporters because of a "60 percent reduction in traffic congestion" 14.

For those who do decide to make a move to help the environment and themselves by reducing their car usage, their are more and more alternatives that are making their switch worthwhile. In Vauban, you can hear the sounds of viable alternatives in use. The "swish of bicycles" and the "chatter"3 of walking children is audible in the streets. Carlos Arturo Plaza rides the carfree streets of Bogota on " atwo seat bicycle with his wife"24. For those who don't feel comfortable with walking or cycling other options such as carpool exist and governments are now making more of an effort to make other alternatives such easier and more available i. e. public transportation. In Bogota, in order to support the movement toward less automobile driving wide sidewalks have been made. In Vauban the whole city has been constructed with the goal to make everything compact and easier to access by foot or bike. This is good news for those who make the early morning busness commute as their job is closer to where they live and more convenient to walk or bike to than other suburbs in which commuters are forced to take the high way because of the distance. Also, the more people who take advantage of whatever public transportation available to them will make the demand higher and cause more funding to be placed on public transportation. Before "80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to high ways and only 20 percent to other transport"9, but with more usage, this can change.

Essentially, the sacrifice of some of our car usage is far outweighed by the positive affects on our environment and attitudes.

This essay will analyze, discuss and prove one reason in favor of keeping the Electoral College in the United States for its presidential elections. One of the reasons to keep the electoral college is that it is better for smaller, more rural states to have more influence as opposed to larger metropolitan areas that have large populations. The electors from these states are granted two votes each. Those from larger, more populated areas are granted just one vote each. Smaller states tend to hold significant power because their two votes for president and vice president add up more than the votes of larger states that have many electors. This is because of the split of the electoral votes. Some argue that electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes nationally. They do not have to vote for their own state's nominee unless their state has a winner take all system. However, there are states that have adopted laws that force their electors to vote for their state's candidate. It seems that, no matter how, electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most nationally. This is not always the case because of state legislatures who can overrule the electors and vote for the alternative candidate their citizens have selected for them, even if the voter lives in a state without a winner take all system.

arguments on whether the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States are occurring today. Each favor has its advantages and disadvantages, but we should favor in keeping the Electoral College. This is because less disputes are likely to happen and not voting will not effect the election.

On the other hand, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States has some advantages. In "Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", author Bradford Plumer claims "the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" because "candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning." This means that the candidates focus on the "tight races of the swing states." To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote counthowever, changing to election by popular vote will cause many disputes and it is not the right way to keep everyone satisfied with voting for a new president. Keeping the Electoral College is more realistic.

To begin, the Electoral College is fair to the states, leaving fewer disputes. In "Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College "restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution." The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with "the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election." To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will receive the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.

In addition, the Electoral College method does not get affected by the ones who chose not to vote. In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President", author Richard A. Posner states that "knowing the voters vote has no effect gives them less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign." But, "voters in presidential electons are people who want to express political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election." This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever.

To conclude, the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College rather than changing to election be popular vote for the president of the United States because less disputes will occur and not participating will not be effective.

Think about how many times a week we get in a car to drive somewhere. I know I drive to school, to lacrosse practice, and to spend time with friends on a weekly basis. Some people may claim that driving is a positive aspect of our culture because it allows us to get from one place to another and accomplish tasks in a timely fashion, but driving in excess has some serious consequences. Although some may argue that it is impossible to completely cut out an action that is essential to our daily lives, and that cutting down on driving would not be advantageous, limiting the amount of time we spend driving has many advantages. Cutting down on automobile use will decrease pollution in our air, and make us healthier and happier, which is why many legislators and cities are reducing automobile use.

Beijing, China, is the most polluted city in the world according to Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune in 2014. source 2 paragraph 14 This is due to the fact that being's automobile use is extremely high. When the city of Paris was faced with a similar crisis, it issued a partial driving ban that allowed people to only drive on days that the government said they could in accordance to their licence plate number, or they would face a fine. source 2 paragraph 1019. This revolutionary ban caused the air pollution in Paris to drop so much that the ban was lifted after only one day. The drop in air pollution clearly refutes the claim that cutting down on driving is not advantageous. Cutting down on automobile use is beneficial to the environment because, according to Elizabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times in 2009 source 1 paragraph 5, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States." Limiting automobile use is crucial to cleaning our air and stopping the burning of fossil fuels, thus explains why is beneficial to limit our car use.

Although some might argue that driving a car to work is easier, evidence shows that people who limit their car use are happier and healthier. Rosenthal writes about the city of Vauban, Germany, where "70% of vaughn's families do not own a car." source 1 paragraph 3 Heidrum Walter, a carless citizen from Vauban, states that, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." source 1 paragraph 3 The concept of people being happier and healthier without cars is further proved in Bogota, Columbia, where, according to Andrew Selsky of the Seattle Times in 2002, "For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million." source 3 paragraph 21 Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, "It's a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"as he rode his bike with his wife. The statements from Walter of Vauban and Plaza of Bogota show how limiting automobile use is advantageous to the overall wellbeing and happiness of people, thus we should limit our automotive use.

Limiting automobile use is so beneficial, that many groups and legislators are supporting a society with less cars. The EPA in the United States is promoting "car reduced" communities, and legislators are starting to act. source 1 paragraph 9 David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, states that, "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change." Sociology proffesor at Drecel University, Mimi Sheller, further elaborates, stating, "Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift." source 4 paragraph 35 The support for a "car reduced" society by the US government and the EPA is the cherry on top to all of the benefits associated with driving less, thus we should limit our automobile use.

Society is changing. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. source 4 paragraph 41 Now is the time to turn off the engine, get out of the car, and take a bus, bike, or train to work. By limiting our automobile use, we keep our air clean by burning less fossil fuels, and we are happier and healthier, which is why organizations like the EPA support the reduction of car use. We need to act today to save the next generation of citizens from ecological destruction. The benefits of reducing car use are countless, which explains why we should limit our automobile use.

Many cities are experiencing perhaps the biggest economic change being implemented into society since the invention of the Model T. People just simply aren't interested in attaining a personal vehicle, or even a license for that matter. As a result, many personal vehicle companies are starting to become more "mobile" to stay with the times, or become bankrupt due to being stagnant in sales. Not owning a car has actually proved to come with more advantages than if owning a car. Such as, less carbon emissions in the air, less stress in certain communities where carfree zones are being implemented, and finally restaurants and stores becoming more "cropped up" due to rushhour restrictions essentially boosting the economy.

The lack of car use has fundamentally benefitted the environment as an entirety. Cars emit carbon emissions into the air that are not only harmful to many animals, but to humans as well. According to Source 2, in Paris, France alone, it was shown that "due to the use of diesel fuel over regular fuel, there were 147 micrograms of particle matter per cubic meter." Comparing this to other major cities in Europe that find more use for regular gasoline, you'll find that the results are less. In Brussels, there were 114 micrograms of PM per cubic meter, and in London, 79.7. Even though areas that used more regular fuel over diesel fuel were significantly lower in micrograms of particle matter, even 79.7 micrograms can be potentially fatal, and cause lungrelated health problems in the later lives of the people occupying these areas. Officials not only in Paris, but also in major cities such as Bogota, Colombia and New York City, New York have also began to take a stand. In Paris, France for example, "there are certain days in which cars cannot be driven by people with license plates ending in even numbers, and the next day by people with license plates ending in odd numbers. This new way of thinking has been implemented into the French law system to help decrease the amount of pollution in the air." Source 2 Bogota has also found a unique approach to a less polluted environment. "Carfree day is a day in which no cars are driven, with the exception of buses and taxis." Source 3 Finally, New York City has implemented a "new bikesharing program in which bicycles can be rented for a costeffective amount. In addition to this, bridge and tunnel tolls have also reflected these new priorities by skyrocketing in price." Source 4 These new implementations have proved beneficial in decreasing the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Many communities have not only found a way to reduce pollution in the air, but also live a more stressfree lifestyle.

Stress and rushhour are known to have some corollation, but newer communities are starting to take a stand by limiting the amount of car usage in their area. Vauban, Germany, a newer community only just established in 2006, is an example of one of these communities that has started to "smart plan." Over 70 percent of Vauban's occupants don't own a car, and 57 percent have sold a car to move there." Source 1 A happier lifestyle has appeared as a result. According to Heidrun Walter, an occupant in Vauban. When she had a car, she was always "tense." But now, she's a much happier mother of two, and the distant hum of an occasional motor vehicle is drowned out by the "chattering of wandering children." Source 1 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA is suggesting that we start implementing these "car reduced" communities in our nation to better society, as well as to provide a more stressfree environment for these new communities' residents. Source 1 Even in Bogota, people have said that the use of no cars is a "great opportunity that has taken away stress and lowered air pollution." Source 3 Not only has pollution been reduced in all of this or the fact that a factor attributing to stress has also been removed, but areas where these communities are starting to form, have also boosted the economy. In Bogota, it has been reported that due to Carfree day, that both "parks and sports centers have started to appear throughout the city. In additon to this, sidewalks have been replaced by more broad, smooth sidewalks. As well as, rushhour traffic has been cut, allowing new restaurants and upscale shopping districts to flourish." Source 3 "Cars are starting to become a thing of the past," according to Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. Even her children 19 and 21 don't have licenses. "They say they're interested, but it's not a priority for them," she later goes on to say. As a result, gas money is saved, and people can spend more money on things that matter to them.

In conclusion, it has been displayed that the advantages of not using a car are starting to outweight the benefits. The lack of car use in these carfree communities is helping to reduce stress and tension on the road, boost not only the community's economy, but also the entire nation's economy as well. In addition to this, the lack of car use is also helping to preserve the environment, by reducing carbon emissions into the air. According to many sociologists and business professionals, the downfall of the car may well be on its way, but it may not be such a bad thing.

The debate on the pros and cons of car usage has been an ongoing one. Slowly, the advantages are beginning to outweigh the disadvantages. Around the world, projects and programs have been started to test the effects of limited car use. Data has proved that limiting car usage will cause less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.

To begin with, gas released from our cars has slowly started to hurt us. "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."source 2. This shows that the gas in our cars is one of the factors responsible for the growing pollution in our air. Reducing the usage of cars will not only benefit us, but also the world we live in.

In addition, almost everyone knows what it is like to be stuck in traffic. The stress inducing event must not be healthy either. By declining the use of cars, congestion will slowly diminish. Promoting other ways of transportation will improve health, mood, and traffic. "rushhour restrictions have drastically cut traffic"source 3.

Furthermore, a large portion of our population are constantly stressed. Car usage is accountable for a good amount of it. "When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," source 1 says a citizen of a "carfree" community. By limiting car usage, healthier ways of transportation are encouraged. For example, hiking, biking, skating, and walking. All of these are extremely healthy compared to sitting in a car. Due to the fact that the United States is the country with the fattest people, these methods should be enforced. Healthy people then start to become happier. Therefore, reducing car usage will benefit our people's lives.

Hence, limiting car usage will create a better environment for people all around the world.
