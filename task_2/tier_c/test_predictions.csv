"In proportion to the development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuable to himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others. There is a greater fulness of life about his own existence, and when there is more life in the units there is more in the mass which is composed of them. As much compression as is necessary to prevent the stronger specimens of human nature from encroaching on the rights of others, cannot be dispensed with; but for this there is ample compensation even in the point of view of human development. The means of development which the individual loses by being prevented from gratifying his inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly obtained at the expense of the development of other people. And even to himself there is a full equivalent in the better development of the social part of his nature, rendered possible by the restraint put upon the selfish part. To be held to rigid rules of justice for the sake of others, develops the feelings and capacities which have the good of others for their object. But to be restrained in things not affecting their good, by their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable, except such force of character as may unfold itself in resisting the restraint. If acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole nature. To give any fair-play to the nature of each, it is essential that different persons should be allowed to lead different lives. In proportion as this latitude has been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy to posterity.",0,0,5.83154e-05,Human,Human
"Accordingly we find, though, of course, with very notable exceptions, that in the main those who have most power are most warlike, and those who have least power are least disposed to hatred of foreign nations. This is one of the evils inseparable from the concentration of power. It will only be cured by the abolition of capitalism if the new system is one which allows very much less power to single individuals. It will not be cured by a system which substitutes the power of Ministers or officials for the power of capitalists This is one reason, additional to those mentioned in the preceding chapter, for desiring to see a diminution in the authority of the State. Not only does the concentration of power tend to cause wars, but, equally, wars and the fear of them bring about the necessity for the concentration of power. So long as the community is exposed to sudden dangers, the possibility of quick decision is absolutely necessary to self-preservation. The cumbrous machinery of deliberative decisions by the people is impossible in a crisis, and therefore so long as crises are likely to occur, it is impossible to abolish the almost autocratic power of governments. In this case, as in most others, each of two correlative evils tends to perpetuate the other. The existence of men with the habit of power increases the risk of war, and the risk of war makes it impossible to establish a system where no man possesses great power. So far we have been considering what is true in the contention that capitalism causes modern wars. It is time now to look at the other side, and to ask ourselves whether the abolition of capitalism would, by itself, be sufficient to prevent war.",0,0,2.7366783e-05,Human,Human
"And a good community does not spring from the glory of the State, but from the unfettered development of individuals: from happiness in daily life, from congenial work giving opportunity for whatever constructiveness each man or woman may possess, from free personal relations embodying love and taking away the roots of envy in thwarted capacity from affection, and above all from the joy of life and its expression in the spontaneous creations of art and science. It is these things that make an age or a nation worthy of existence, and these things are not to be secured by bowing down before the State. It is the individual in whom all that is good must be realized, and the free growth of the individual must be the supreme end of a political system which is to re-fashion the world. THE main objects which should be served by international relations may be taken to be two: First, the avoidance of wars, and, second, the prevention of the oppression of weak nations by strong ones. These two objects do not by any means necessarily lead in the same direction, since one of the easiest ways of securing the world's peace would be by a combination of the most powerful States for the exploitation and oppression of the remainder. This method, however, is not one which the lover of liberty can favor. We must keep account of both aims and not be content with either alone. One of the commonplaces of both Socialism and Anarchism is that all modern wars are due to capitalism, and would cease if capitalism were abolished.",0,0,0.00012120335,Human,Human
"It is accurate if I met Jones, inaccurate if I met Brown, but precise in either case as against the mere recollection that I met a man. The distinction between accuracy and precision is however, not fundamental. We may omit precision from out thoughts and confine ourselves to the distinction between accuracy and vagueness. We may then set up the following definitions: An instrument is ""reliable"" with respect to a given set of stimuli when to stimuli which are not relevantly different it gives always responses which are not relevantly different. An instrument is a ""measure"" of a set of stimuli which are serially ordered when its responses, in all cases where they are relevantly different, are arranged in a series in the same order. The ""degree of accuracy"" of an instrument which is a reliable measurer is the ratio of the difference of response to the difference of stimulus in cases where the difference of stimulus is small. That is to say, if a small difference of stimulus produces a great difference of response, the instrument is very accurate; in the contrary case, very inaccurate. Strictly speaking, the limit of this, i.e. the derivative of the response with respect to the stimulus. A mental response is called ""vague"" in proportion to its lack of accuracy, or rather precision. These definitions will be found useful, not only in the case of memory, but in almost all questions concerned with knowledge. It should be observed that vague beliefs, so far from being necessarily false, have a better chance of truth than precise ones, though their truth is less valuable than that of precise beliefs, since they do not distinguish between occurrences which may differ in important ways.",0,0,9.158304e-05,Human,Human
"What, then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual over himself? How much of human life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society? Each will receive its proper share, if each has that which more particularly concerns it. To individuality should belong the part of life in which it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to society, the part which chiefly interests society. Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all that society may do. The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the length of violating any of their constituted rights. The offender may then be justly punished by opinion though not by law.",0,0,6.447184e-05,Human,Human
"A rule thus self-convicted of absurdity so far as regards its professed purpose, can be kept in force only as a badge of hatred, a relic of persecution; a persecution, too, having the peculiarity, that the qualification for undergoing it, is the being clearly proved not to deserve it. The rule, and the theory it implies, are hardly less insulting to believers than to infidels. For if he who does not believe in a future state, necessarily lies, it follows that they who do believe are only prevented from lying, if prevented they are, by the fear of hell. We will not do the authors and abettors of the rule the injury of supposing, that the conception which they have formed of Christian virtue is drawn from their own consciousness. These, indeed, are but rags and remnants of persecution, and may be thought to be not so much an indication of the wish to persecute, as an example of that very frequent infirmity of English minds, which makes them take a preposterous pleasure in the assertion of a bad principle, when they are no longer bad enough to desire to carry it really into practice. But unhappily there is no security in the state of the public mind, that the suspension of worse forms of legal persecution, which has lasted for about the space of a generation, will continue. In this age the quiet surface of routine is as often ruffled by attempts to resuscitate past evils, as to introduce new benefits.",0,0,2.2631091e-05,Human,Human
"By degrees, this new demand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent object of the exertions of the popular party, wherever any such party existed; and superseded, to a considerable extent, the previous efforts to limit the power of rulers. As the struggle proceeded for making the ruling power emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled, some persons began to think that too much importance had been attached to the limitation of the power itself. _That_ (it might seem) was a resource against rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the people. What was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identified with the people; that their interest and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will. There was no fear of its tyrannising over itself. Let the rulers be effectually responsible to it, promptly removable by it, and it could afford to trust them with power of which it could itself dictate the use to be made. Their power was but the nation's own power, concentrated, and in a form convenient for exercise. This mode of thought, or rather perhaps of feeling, was common among the last generation of European liberalism, in the Continental section of which it still apparently predominates. Those who admit any limit to what a government may do, except in the case of such governments as they think ought not to exist, stand out as brilliant exceptions among the political thinkers of the Continent. A similar tone of sentiment might by this time have been prevalent in our own country, if the circumstances which for a time encouraged it, had continued unaltered.",0,0,5.878328e-05,Human,Human
"Thus the animal's reflex and voluntary performances shade into each other gradually, being connected by acts which may often occur automatically, but may also be modified by conscious intelligence. ""An outside observer, unable to perceive the accompanying consciousness, might be wholly at a loss to discriminate between the automatic acts and those which volition escorted. But if the criterion of mind's existence be the choice of the proper means for the attainment of a supposed end, all the acts alike seem to be inspired by intelligence, for APPROPRIATENESS characterizes them all alike."" There is one movement, among those that James mentions at first, which is not subsequently classified, namely, the stumbling. This is the kind of movement which may be called ""mechanical""; it is evidently of a different kind from either reflex or voluntary movements, and more akin to the movements of dead matter. We may define a movement of an animal's body as ""mechanical"" when it proceeds as if only dead matter were involved. For example, if you fall over a cliff, you move under the influence of gravitation, and your centre of gravity describes just as correct a parabola as if you were already dead. Mechanical movements have not the characteristic of appropriateness, unless by accident, as when a drunken man falls into a waterbutt and is sobered. But reflex and voluntary movements are not ALWAYS appropriate, unless in some very recondite sense. A moth flying into a lamp is not acting sensibly; no more is a man who is in such a hurry to get his ticket that he cannot remember the name of his destination. Appropriateness is a complicated and merely approximate idea, and for the present we shall do well to dismiss it from our thoughts.",0,0,3.521768e-05,Human,Human
"Indeed, the Secretary of the C. G. T., Monsieur Jouhaux, recognizes that the C. G. T. is mild in comparison with the I. W. W. ``The I. W. W.,'' he says, ``preach a policy of militant action, very necessary in parts of America, which would not do in France.'' A very interesting account of it, from the point of view of an author who is neither wholly on the side of labor nor wholly on the side of the capitalist, but disinterestedly anxious to find some solution of the social question short of violence and revolution, is the work of Mr. John Graham Brooks, called ``American Syndicalism: the I. W. W.'' (Macmillan, 1913). American labor conditions are very different from those of Europe. In the first place, the power of the trusts is enormous; the concentration of capital has in this respect proceeded more nearly on Marxian lines in America than anywhere else. In the second place, the great influx of foreign labor makes the whole problem quite different from any that arises in Europe. The older skilled workers, largely American born, have long been organized in the American Federation of Labor under Mr. Gompers. They tend to work with the employers against the great mass of unskilled immigrants, and they cannot be regarded as forming part of anything that could be truly called a labor movement. ``There are,'' says Mr. Cole, ``now in America two working classes, with different standards of life, and both are at present almost impotent in the face of the employers. Nor is it possible for these two classes to unite or to put forward any demands. The American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Workers of the World represent two different principles of combination; but they also represent two different classes of labor.'' The I. W. W. stands for industrial unionism, whereas the American Federation of Labor stands for craft unionism.",0,0,1.598716e-05,Human,Human
"A world full of happiness would not wish to plunge into war, and would not be filled with that grudging hostility which our cramped and narrow existence forces upon average human nature. A world full of happiness is not beyond human power to create; the obstacles imposed by inanimate nature are not insuperable. The real obstacles lie in the heart of man, and the cure for these is a firm hope, informed and fortified by thought. SOCIALISM has been advocated by most of its champions chiefly as a means of increasing the welfare of the wage earning classes, and more particularly their material welfare. It has seemed accordingly, to some men whose aims are not material, as if it has nothing to offer toward the general advancement of civilization in the way of art and thought. Some of its advocates, moreover--and among these Marx must be included--have written, no doubt not deliberately, as if with the Socialist revolution the millennium would have arrived, and there would be no need of further progress for the human race. I do not know whether our age is more restless than that which preceded it, or whether it has merely become more impregnated with the idea of evolution, but, for whatever reason, we have grown incapable of believing in a state of static perfection, and we demand, of any social system, which is to have our approval, that it shall contain within itself a stimulus and opportunity for progress toward something still better. The doubts thus raised by Socialist writers make it necessary to inquire whether Socialism would in fact be hostile to art and science, and whether it would be likely to produce a stereotyped society in which progress would become difficult and slow.",0,0,2.0135703e-05,Human,Human
"An Englishman fancies that things do not exist, because he never sees them; a Frenchman thinks they must always and necessarily exist, because he does see them. An Englishman does not know nature, because he has had no opportunity of observing it; a Frenchman generally knows a great deal of it, but often mistakes it, because he has only seen it sophisticated and distorted. For the artificial state superinduced by society disguises the natural tendencies of the thing which is the subject of observation, in two different ways: by extinguishing the nature, or by transforming it. In the one case there is but a starved residuum of nature remaining to be studied; in the other case there is much, but it may have expanded in any direction rather than that in which it would spontaneously grow. I have said that it cannot now be known how much of the existing mental differences between men and women is natural, and how much artificial; whether there are any natural differences at all; or, supposing all artificial causes of difference to be withdrawn, what natural character would be revealed. I am not about to attempt what I have pronounced impossible: but doubt does not forbid conjecture, and where certainty is unattainable, there may yet be the means of arriving at some degree of probability. The first point, the origin of the differences actually observed, is the one most accessible to speculation; and I shall attempt to approach it, by the only path by which it can be reached; by tracing the mental consequences of external influences.",0,0,1.9425552e-05,Human,Human
"Of course, in actual fact, human learning is rendered easier, though psychologically more complex, through language; but at bottom language does not alter the essential character of learning, or of the part played by instinct in promoting learning. Language, however, is a subject upon which I do not wish to speak until a later lecture. The popular conception of instinct errs by imagining it to be infallible and preternaturally wise, as well as incapable of modification. Instinct, as a rule, is very rough and ready, able to achieve its result under ordinary circumstances, but easily misled by anything unusual. Chicks follow their mother by instinct, but when they are quite young they will follow with equal readiness any moving object remotely resembling their mother, or even a human being (James, ""Psychology,"" ii, 396). Bergson, quoting Fabre, has made play with the supposed extraordinary accuracy of the solitary wasp Ammophila, which lays its eggs in a caterpillar. On this subject I will quote from Drever's ""Instinct in Man,"" p. 92: ""According to Fabre's observations, which Bergson accepts, the Ammophila stings its prey EXACTLY and UNERRINGLY in EACH of the nervous centres. The result is that the caterpillar is paralyzed, but not immediately killed, the advantage of this being that the larva cannot be injured by any movement of the caterpillar, upon which the egg is deposited, and is provided with fresh meat when the time comes.",0,0,0.00029427235,Human,Human
"The war of 1870 put an end for the time being to the Socialist Movement in France. Its revival was begun by Jules Guesde in 1877. Unlike the Ger- man Socialists, the French have been split into many different factions. In the early eighties there was a split between the Parliamentary Socialists and the Communist Anarchists. The latter thought that the first act of the Social Revolution should be the destruction of the State, and would therefore have nothing to do with Parliamentary politics. The Anarchists, from 1883 onward, had success in Paris and the South. The Socialists contended that the State will disappear after the Socialist society has been firmly established. In 1882 the Socialists split between the followers of Guesde, who claimed to represent the revolutionary and scientific Socialism of Marx, and the followers of Paul Brousse, who were more opportunist and were also called possibilists and cared little for the theories of Marx. In 1890 there was a secession from the Broussists, who followed Allemane and absorbed the more revolutionary elements of the party and became leading spirits in some of the strongest syndicates. Another group was the Independent Socialists, among whom were Jaures, Millerand and Viviani. The disputes between the various sections of Socialists caused difficulties in the Trade Unions and helped to bring about the resolution to keep politics out of the Unions. From this to Syndicalism was an easy step. Since the year 1905, as the result of a union between the Parti Socialiste de France (Part; Ouvrier Socialiste Revolutionnaire Francais led by Guesde) and the Parti Socialiste Francais (Jaures), there have been only two groups of Socialists, the United Socialist Party and the Independents, who are intellectuals or not willing to be tied to a party.",0,0,0.0011727074,Human,Human
"And there are so many causes tending to make the feelings connected with this subject the most intense and most deeply-rooted of all those which gather round and protect old institutions and customs, that we need not wonder to find them as yet less undermined and loosened than any of the rest by the progress of the great modern spiritual and social transition; nor suppose that the barbarisms to which men cling longest must be less barbarisms than those which they earlier shake off. In every respect the burthen is hard on those who attack an almost universal opinion. They must be very fortunate as well as unusually capable if they obtain a hearing at all. They have more difficulty in obtaining a trial, than any other litigants have in getting a verdict. If they do extort a hearing, they are subjected to a set of logical requirements totally different from those exacted from other people. In all other cases, the burthen of proof is supposed to lie with the affirmative. If a person is charged with a murder, it rests with those who accuse him to give proof of his guilt, not with himself to prove his innocence. If there is a difference of opinion about the reality of any alleged historical event, in which the feelings of men in general are not much interested, as the Siege of Troy for example, those who maintain that the event took place are expected to produce their proofs, before those who take the other side can be required to say anything; and at no time are these required to do more than show that the evidence produced by the others is of no value.",0,0,1.2445691e-05,Human,Human
"In order, therefore, to arrive at what really is sensation in an occurrence which, at first sight, seems to contain nothing else, we have to pare away all that is due to habit or expectation or interpretation. This is a matter for the psychologist, and by no means an easy matter. For our purposes, it is not important to determine what exactly is the sensational core in any case; it is only important to notice that there certainly is a sensational core, since habit, expectation and interpretation are diversely aroused on diverse occasions, and the diversity is clearly due to differences in what is presented to the senses. When you open your newspaper in the morning, the actual sensations of seeing the print form a very minute part of what goes on in you, but they are the starting-point of all the rest, and it is through them that the newspaper is a means of information or mis-information. Thus, although it may be difficult to determine what exactly is sensation in any given experience, it is clear that there is sensation, unless, like Leibniz, we deny all action of the outer world upon us. Sensations are obviously the source of our knowledge of the world, including our own body. It might seem natural to regard a sensation as itself a cognition, and until lately I did so regard it. When, say, I see a person I know coming towards me in the street, it SEEMS as though the mere seeing were knowledge. It is of course undeniable that knowledge comes THROUGH the seeing, but I think it is a mistake to regard the mere seeing itself as knowledge.",0,0,2.07672e-05,Human,Human
"To take extreme cases, every animal at birth can take food by instinct, before it has had opportunity to learn; on the other hand, no one can ride a bicycle by instinct, though, after learning, the necessary movements become just as automatic as if they were instinctive. The process of learning, which consists in the acquisition of habits, has been much studied in various animals. For example: you put a hungry animal, say a cat, in a cage which has a door that can be opened by lifting a latch; outside the cage you put food. The cat at first dashes all round the cage, making frantic efforts to force a way out. At last, by accident, the latch is lifted and the cat pounces on the food. Next day you repeat the experiment, and you find that the cat gets out much more quickly than the first time, although it still makes some random movements. The third day it gets out still more quickly, and before long it goes straight to the latch and lifts it at once. Or you make a model of the Hampton Court maze, and put a rat in the middle, assaulted by the smell of food on the outside. The rat starts running down the passages, and is constantly stopped by blind alleys, but at last, by persistent attempts, it gets out. You repeat this experiment day after day; you measure the time taken by the rat in reaching the food; you find that the time rapidly diminishes, and that after a while the rat ceases to make any wrong turnings. It is by essentially similar processes that we learn speaking, writing, mathematics, or the government of an empire.",0,0,1.9874622e-05,Human,Human
"Is there so great a superfluity of men fit for high duties, that society can afford to reject the service of any competent person? Are we so certain of always finding a man made to our hands for any duty or function of social importance which falls vacant, that we lose nothing by putting a ban upon one-half of mankind, and refusing beforehand to make their faculties available, however distinguished they may be? And even if we could do without them, would it be consistent with justice to refuse to them their fair share of honour and distinction, or to deny to them the equal moral right of all human beings to choose their occupation (short of injury to others) according to their own preferences, at their own risk? Nor is the injustice confined to them: it is shared by those who are in a position to benefit by their services. To ordain that any kind of persons shall not be physicians, or shall not be advocates, or shall not be members of parliament, is to injure not them only, but all who employ physicians or advocates, or elect members of parliament, and who are deprived of the stimulating effect of greater competition on the exertions of the competitors, as well as restricted to a narrower range of individual choice.

"The greatest harm done is to those who are not heretics, and whose whole mental development is cramped, and their reason cowed, by the fear of heresy. Who can compute what the world loses in the multitude of promising intellects combined with timid characters, who dare not follow out any bold, vigorous, independent train of thought, lest it should land them in something which would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral? Among them we may occasionally see some man of deep conscientiousness, and subtle and refined understanding, who spends a life in sophisticating with an intellect which he cannot silence, and exhausts the resources of ingenuity in attempting to reconcile the promptings of his conscience and reason with orthodoxy, which yet he does not, perhaps, to the end succeed in doing. No one can be a great thinker who does not recognise, that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his intellect to whatever conclusions it may lead. Truth gains more even by the errors of one who, with due study and preparation, thinks for himself, than by the true opinions of those who only hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think. Not that it is solely, or chiefly, to form great thinkers, that freedom of thinking is required. On the contrary, it is as much, and even more indispensable, to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature which they are capable of. There have been, and may again be, great individual thinkers, in a general atmosphere of mental slavery.

"Whatever any portion of the human species now are, or seem to be, such, it is supposed, they have a natural tendency to be: even when the most elementary knowledge of the circumstances in which they have been placed, clearly points out the causes that made them what they are. Because a cottier deeply in arrears to his landlord is not industrious, there are people who think that the Irish are naturally idle. Because constitutions can be overthrown when the authorities appointed to execute them turn their arms against them, there are people who think the French incapable of free government. Because the Greeks cheated the Turks, and the Turks only plundered the Greeks, there are persons who think that the Turks are naturally more sincere: and because women, as is often said, care nothing about politics except their personalities, it is supposed that the general good is naturally less interesting to women than to men. History, which is now so much better understood than formerly, teaches another lesson: if only by showing the extraordinary susceptibility of human nature to external influences, and the extreme variableness of those of its manifestations which are supposed to be most universal and uniform. But in history, as in travelling, men usually see only what they already had in their own minds; and few learn much from history, who do not bring much with them to its study. Hence, in regard to that most difficult question, what are the natural differences between the two sexes--a subject on which it is impossible in the present state of society to obtain complete and correct knowledge--while almost everybody dogmatizes upon it, almost all neglect and make light of the only means by which any partial insight can be obtained into it.",0,0,1.7027964e-05,Human,Human
"At present, the capitalist has more control over the lives of others than any man ought to have; his friends have authority in the State; his economic power is the pattern for political power. In a world where all men and women enjoy economic freedom, there will not be the same habit of command, nor, consequently, the same love of despotism; a gentler type of character than that now prevalent will gradually grow up. Men are formed by their circumstances, not born ready- made. The bad effect of the present economic system on character, and the immensely better effect to be expected from communal ownership, are among the strongest reasons for advocating the change. In the world as we have been imagining fit, economic fear and most economic hope will be alike removed out of life. No one will be haunted by the dread of poverty or driven into ruthlessness by the hope of wealth. There will not be the distinction of social classes which now plays such an immense part in life. The unsuccessful professional man will not live in terror lest his children should sink in the scale; the aspiring employe will not be looking forward to the day when he can become a sweater in his turn. Ambitious young men will have to dream other daydreams than that of business success and wealth wrung out of the ruin of competitors and the degradation of labor. In such a world, most of the nightmares that lurk in the background of men's minds will no longer exist; on the other hand, ambition and the desire to excel will have to take nobler forms than those that are encouraged by a commercial society.",0,0,6.120372e-05,Human,Human
"If public opinion is to be really effective, it will be necessary to have some method of dividing the community into small groups, and to allow each group to consume only the equivalent of what it produces. This will make the economic motive operative upon the group, which, since we are supposing it small, will feel that its collective share is appreciably diminished by each idle individual. Such a system might be feasible, but it would be contrary to the whole spirit of Anarchism and would destroy the main lines of its economic system. ``As to the so-often repeated objection that nobody would labor if he were not compelled to do so by sheer necessity, we heard enough of it before the emancipation of slaves in America, as well as before the emancipation of serfs in Russia; and we have had the opportunity of appreciating it at its just value. So we shall not try to convince those who can be convinced only by accomplished facts. As to those who reason, they ought to know that, if it really was so with some parts of humanity at its lowest stages--and yet, what do we know about it?--or if it is so with some small communities, or separate individuals, brought to sheer despair by ill-success in their struggle against unfavorable conditions, it is not so with the bulk of the civilized nations. With us, work is a habit, and idleness an artificial growth.'' The attitude of orthodox Socialism on this question is quite different from that of Anarchism. Among the more immediate measures advocated in the ``Communist Manifesto'' is ``equal liability of all to labor. The Socialist theory is that, in general, work alone gives the right to the enjoyment of the produce of work.",0,0,1.2675071e-05,Human,Human
"If alcohol could be obtained at cost price without taxation, still more if it could be obtained for nothing, as Anarchists presumably desire, can we believe that there would not be a great and disastrous increase of drunkenness? China was brought to the verge of ruin by opium, and every patriotic Chinaman desired to see the traffic in opium restricted. In such matters freedom is not a panacea, and some degree of legal restriction seems imperative for the national health. But granting that the State, in some form, must continue, we must also grant, I think, that its powers ought to be very strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary. There is no way of limiting its powers except by means of groups which are jealous of their privileges and determined to preserve their autonomy, even if this should involve resistance to laws decreed by the State, when these laws interfere in the internal affairs of a group in ways not warranted by the public interest. The glorification of the State, and the doctrine that it is every citizen's duty to serve the State, are radically against progress and against liberty. The State, though at present a source of much evil, is also a means to certain good things, and will be needed so long as violent and destructive impulses remain common. But it is MERELY a means, and a means which needs to be very carefully and sparingly used if it is not to do more harm than good.

"It has become increasingly difficult to put trust in the State as a means to liberty, or in political parties as instruments sufficiently powerful to force the State into the service of the people. The modern State, says Sorel, ``is a body of intellectuals, which is invested with privileges, and which possesses means of the kind called political for defending itself against the attacks made on it by other groups of intellectuals, eager to possess the profits of public employment. Parties are constituted in order to acquire the conquest of these employments, and they are analogous to the State.'' Syndicalists aim at organizing men, not by party, but by occupation. This, they say, alone represents the true conception and method of the class war. Accordingly they despise all POLITICAL action through the medium of Parliament and elections: the kind of action that they recommend is direct action by the revolutionary syndicate or trade union. The battle- cry of industrial versus political action has spread far beyond the ranks of French Syndicalism. It is to be found in the I. W. W. in America, and among Industrial Unionists and Guild Socialists in Great Britain. Those who advocate it, for the most part, aim also at a different goal from that of Marx. They believe that there can be no adequate individual freedom where the State is all-powerful, even if the State be a Socialist one. Some of them are out-and- out Anarchists, who wish to see the State wholly abolished; others only wish to curtail its authority. Owing to this movement, opposition to Marx, which from the Anarchist side existed from the first, has grown very strong. It is this opposition in its older form that will occupy us in our next chapter.",0,0,4.0267885e-05,Human,Human
"For want of this, they often not only overlook the contradiction which outward facts oppose to their theories, but lose sight of the legitimate purpose of speculation altogether, and let their speculative faculties go astray into regions not peopled with real beings, animate or inanimate, even idealized, but with personified shadows created by the illusions of metaphysics or by the mere entanglement of words, and think these shadows the proper objects of the highest, the most transcendant, philosophy. Hardly anything can be of greater value to a man of theory and speculation who employs himself not in collecting materials of knowledge by observation, but in working them up by processes of thought into comprehensive truths of science and laws of conduct, than to carry on his speculations in the companionship, and under the criticism, of a really superior woman. There is nothing comparable to it for keeping his thoughts within the limits of real things, and the actual facts of nature. A woman seldom runs wild after an abstraction. The habitual direction of her mind to dealing with things as individuals rather than in groups, and (what is closely connected with it) her more lively interest in the present feelings of persons, which makes her consider first of all, in anything which claims to be applied to practice, in what manner persons will be affected by it--these two things make her extremely unlikely to put faith in any speculation which loses sight of individuals, and deals with things as if they existed for the benefit of some imaginary entity, some mere creation of the mind, not resolvable into the feelings of living beings. Women's thoughts are thus as useful in giving reality to those of thinking men, as men's thoughts in giving width and largeness to those of women.",0,0,0.009315014,Human,Human
"And among leaders, ambition, which they mortify in their choice of a career, is sure to return in a new form: in the desire for intellectual mastery and for despotic power within their own sect. From these causes it results that the advocates of drastic reform divide themselves into opposing schools, hating each other with a bitter hatred, accusing each other often of such crimes as being in the pay of the police, and demanding, of any speaker or writer whom they are to admire, that he shall conform exactly to their prejudices, and make all his teaching minister to their belief that the exact truth is to be found within the limits of their creed. The result of this state of mind is that, to a casual and unimaginative attention, the men who have sacrificed most through the wish to benefit mankind APPEAR to be actuated far more by hatred than by love. And the demand for orthodoxy is stifling to any free exercise of intellect. This cause, as well as economic prejudice, has made it difficult for the ``intellectuals'' to co-operate prac- tically with the more extreme reformers, however they may sympathize with their main purposes and even with nine-tenths of their program. Another reason why radical reformers are misjudged by ordinary men is that they view existing society from outside, with hostility towards its institutions. Although, for the most part, they have more belief than their neighbors in human nature's inherent capacity for a good life, they are so conscious of the cruelty and oppression resulting from existing institutions that they make a wholly misleading impression of cynicism.",0,0,6.341936e-05,Human,Human
"The animals in cages, which gradually learn to get out, perform random movements at first, which are purely instinctive. But for these random movements, they would never acquire the experience which afterwards enables them to produce the right movement. (This is partly questioned by Hobhouse--wrongly, I think.) Similarly, children learning to talk make all sorts of sounds, until one day the right sound comes by accident. It is clear that the original making of random sounds, without which speech would never be learnt, is instinctive. I think we may say the same of all the habits and aptitudes that we acquire in all of them there has been present throughout some instinctive activity, prompting at first rather inefficient movements, but supplying the driving force while more and more effective methods are being acquired. A cat which is hungry smells fish, and goes to the larder. This is a thoroughly efficient method when there is fish in the larder, and it is often successfully practised by children. But in later life it is found that merely going to the larder does not cause fish to be there; after a series of random movements it is found that this result is to be caused by going to the City in the morning and coming back in the evening. No one would have guessed a priori that this movement of a middle-aged man's body would cause fish to come out of the sea into his larder, but experience shows that it does, and the middle-aged man therefore continues to go to the City, just as the cat in the cage continues to lift the latch when it has once found it.",0,0,1.1895706e-05,Human,Human
"Already in 1842 he became editor of a newspaper, which was suppressed by the Prussian Government early in the following year on account of its advanced opinions. This led Marx to go to Paris, where he became known as a Socialist and acquired a knowledge of his French predecessors. Here in the year 1844 began his lifelong friendship with Engels, who had been hitherto in business in Manchester, where he had become acquainted with English Socialism and had in the main adopted its doctrines. In 1845 Marx was expelled from Paris and went with Engels to live in Brussels. There he formed a German Working Men's Association and edited a paper which was their organ. Through his activities in Brussels he became known to the German Communist League in Paris, who, at the end of 1847, invited him and Engels to draw up for them a manifesto, which appeared in January, 1848. This is the famous ``Communist Manifesto,'' in which for the first time Marx's system is set forth. In the following month, February, the revolution broke out in Paris, and in March it spread to Germany. Fear of the revolution led the Brussels Government to expel Marx from Belgium, but the German revolution made it possible for him to return to his own country. In Germany he again edited a paper, which again led him into a conflict with the authorities, increasing in severity as the reaction gathered force. In June, 1849, his paper was suppressed, and he was expelled from Prussia. He returned to Paris, but was expelled from there also. This led him to settle in England--at that time an asylum for friends of freedom--and in England, with only brief intervals for purposes of agitation, he continued to live until his death in 1883.",0,0,3.9334333e-05,Human,Human
"As it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different opinions, so is it that there should be different experiments of living; that free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when any one thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short, that in things which do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself. Where, not the person's own character, but the traditions or customs of other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social progress. In maintaining this principle, the greatest difficulty to be encountered does not lie in the appreciation of means towards an acknowledged end, but in the indifference of persons in general to the end itself. If it were felt that the free development of individuality is one of the leading essentials of well-being; that it is not only a co-ordinate element with all that is designated by the terms civilisation, instruction, education, culture, but is itself a necessary part and condition of all those things; there would be no danger that liberty should be under-valued, and the adjustment of the boundaries between it and social control would present no extraordinary difficulty. But the evil is, that individual spontaneity is hardly recognised by the common modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any regard on its own account.",0,0,5.383979e-05,Human,Human
"If people are mostly so little aware how completely, during the greater part of the duration of our species, the law of force was the avowed rule of general conduct, any other being only a special and exceptional consequence of peculiar ties--and from how very recent a date it is that the affairs of society in general have been even pretended to be regulated according to any moral law; as little do people remember or consider, how institutions and customs which never had any ground but the law of force, last on into ages and states of general opinion which never would have permitted their first establishment. Less than forty years ago, Englishmen might still by law hold human beings in bondage as saleable property: within the present century they might kidnap them and carry them off, and work them literally to death. This absolutely extreme case of the law of force, condemned by those who can tolerate almost every other form of arbitrary power, and which, of all others, presents features the most revolting to the feelings of all who look at it from an impartial position, was the law of civilized and Christian England within the memory of persons now living: and in one half of Anglo-Saxon America three or four years ago, not only did slavery exist, but the slave trade, and the breeding of slaves expressly for it, was a general practice between slave states.",0,0,1.871855e-05,Human,Human
"It does not follow, nor can I admit, that these obligations extend to requiring the fulfilment of the contract at all costs to the happiness of the reluctant party; but they are a necessary element in the question; and even if, as Von Humboldt maintains, they ought to make no difference in the _legal_ freedom of the parties to release themselves from the engagement (and I also hold that they ought not to make _much_ difference), they necessarily make a great difference in the _moral_ freedom. A person is bound to take all these circumstances into account, before resolving on a step which may affect such important interests of others; and if he does not allow proper weight to those interests, he is morally responsible for the wrong. I have made these obvious remarks for the better illustration of the general principle of liberty, and not because they are at all needed on the particular question, which, on the contrary, is usually discussed as if the interest of children was everything, and that of grown persons nothing. I have already observed that, owing to the absence of any recognised general principles, liberty is often granted where it should be withheld, as well as withheld where it should be granted; and one of the cases in which, in the modern European world, the sentiment of liberty is the strongest, is a case where, in my view, it is altogether misplaced. A person should be free to do as he likes in his own concerns; but he ought not to be free to do as he likes in acting for another, under the pretext that the affairs of another are his own affairs.",0,0,1.2971094e-05,Human,Human
"There is therefore no a priori objection to a causal law in which part of the cause has ceased to exist. To argue against such a law on the ground that what is past cannot operate now, is to introduce the old metaphysical notion of cause, for which science can find no place. The only reason that could be validly alleged against mnemic causation would be that, in fact, all the phenomena can be explained without it. They are explained without it by Semon's ""engram,"" or by any theory which regards the results of experience as embodied in modifications of the brain and nerves. But they are not explained, unless with extreme artificiality, by any theory which regards the latent effects of experience as psychical rather than physical. Those who desire to make psychology as far as possible independent of physiology would do well, it seems to me, if they adopted mnemic causation. For my part, however, I have no such desire, and I shall therefore endeavour to state the grounds which occur to me in favour of some such view as that of the ""engram."" One of the first points to be urged is that mnemic phenomena are just as much to be found in physiology as in psychology. They are even to be found in plants, as Sir Francis Darwin pointed out (cf. Semon, ""Die Mneme,"" 2nd edition, p. 28 n.). Habit is a characteristic of the body at least as much as of the mind. We should, therefore, be compelled to allow the intrusion of mnemic causation, if admitted at all, into non-psychological regions, which ought, one feels, to be subject only to causation of the ordinary physical sort.",0,0,1.15203975e-05,Human,Human
"Trade Unions were to be permeated with the belief that the day for purely industrial action was past, and that they must look to government (inspired secretly by sympathetic civil servants) to bring about, bit by bit, such parts of the Socialist program as were not likely to rouse much hostility in the rich. The Independent Labor Party (formed in 1893) was largely inspired at first by the ideas of the Fabians, though retaining to the present day, and especially since the outbreak of the war, much more of the original Socialist ardor. It aimed always at co-operation with the industrial organizations of wage-earners, and, chiefly through its efforts, the Labor Party was formed in 1900 out of a combination of the Trade Unions and the political Socialists. To this party, since 1909, all the important Unions have belonged, but in spite of the fact that its strength is derived from Trade Unions, it has stood always for political rather than industrial action. Its Socialism has been of a theoretical and academic order, and in practice, until the outbreak of war, the Labor members in Parliament (of whom 30 were elected in 1906 and 42 in December, 1910) might be reckoned almost as a part of the Liberal Party. Of which the Independent Labor Party is only a section. France, unlike England and Germany, was not content merely to repeat the old shibboleths with continually diminishing conviction. In France a new movement, originally known as Revolutionary Syndicalism--and afterward simply as Syndicalism-- kept alive the vigor of the original impulse, and remained true to the spirit of the older Socialists, while departing from the letter.",0,0,3.5377736e-05,Human,Human
"It would be well, indeed, if this good office were much more freely rendered than the common notions of politeness at present permit, and if one person could honestly point out to another that he thinks him in fault, without being considered unmannerly or presuming. We have a right, also, in various ways, to act upon our unfavourable opinion of any one, not to the oppression of his individuality, but in the exercise of ours. We are not bound, for example, to seek his society; we have a right to avoid it (though not to parade the avoidance), for we have a right to choose the society most acceptable to us. We have a right, and it may be our duty, to caution others against him, if we think his example or conversation likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates. We may give others a preference over him in optional good offices, except those which tend to his improvement. In these various modes a person may suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others, for faults which directly concern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so far as they are the natural, and, as it were, the spontaneous consequences of the faults themselves, not because they are purposely inflicted on him for the sake of punishment.",0,0,2.3741732e-05,Human,Human
"To an ordinary man, however, his own preference, thus supported, is not only a perfectly satisfactory reason, but the only one he generally has for any of his notions of morality, taste, or propriety, which are not expressly written in his religious creed; and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that. Men's opinions, accordingly, on what is laudable or blamable, are affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes in regard to the conduct of others, and which are as numerous as those which determine their wishes on any other subject. Sometimes their reason--at other times their prejudices or superstitions: often their social affections, not seldom their anti-social ones, their envy or jealousy, their arrogance or contemptuousness: but most commonly, their desires or fears for themselves--their legitimate or illegitimate self-interest. Wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of the morality of the country emanates from its class interests, and its feelings of class superiority. The morality between Spartans and Helots, between planters and negroes, between princes and subjects, between nobles and roturiers, between men and women, has been for the most part the creation of these class interests and feelings: and the sentiments thus generated, react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members of the ascendant class, in their relations among themselves. Where, on the other hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, or where its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments frequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority. Another grand determining principle of the rules of conduct, both in act and forbearance, which have been enforced by law or opinion, has been the servility of mankind towards the supposed preferences or aversions of their temporal masters, or of their gods.",0,0,0.0002005736,Human,Human
"It is true that the image is not absolutely identical with its prototype, and if the word ""this"" meant the image to the exclusion of everything else, the judgment ""this occurred"" would be false. But identity is a precise conception, and no word, in ordinary speech, stands for anything precise. Ordinary speech does not distinguish between identity and close similarity. A word always applies, not only to one particular, but to a group of associated particulars, which are not recognized as multiple in common thought or speech. Thus primitive memory, when it judges that ""this occurred,"" is vague, but not false. Vague identity, which is really close similarity, has been a source of many of the confusions by which philosophy has lived. Of a vague subject, such as a ""this,"" which is both an image and its prototype, contradictory predicates are true simultaneously: this existed and does not exist, since it is a thing remembered, but also this exists and did not exist, since it is a present image. Hence Bergson's interpenetration of the present by the past, Hegelian continuity and identity-in-diversity, and a host of other notions which are thought to be profound because they are obscure and confused. The contradictions resulting from confounding image and prototype in memory force us to precision. But when we become precise, our remembering becomes different from that of ordinary life, and if we forget this we shall go wrong in the analysis of ordinary memory. Vagueness and accuracy are important notions, which it is very necessary to understand. All thinking is vague to some extent, and complete accuracy is a theoretical ideal not practically attainable. To understand what is meant by accuracy, it will be well to consider first instruments of measurement, such as a balance or a thermometer.",0,0,0.018805701,Human,Human
"The notion of perception is therefore not a precise one: we perceive things more or less, but always with a very considerable amount of vagueness and confusion. In considering irregular appearances, there are certain very natural mistakes which must be avoided. In order that a particular may count as an irregular appearance of a certain object, it is not necessary that it should bear any resemblance to the regular appearances as regard its intrinsic qualities. All that is necessary is that it should be derivable from the regular appearances by the laws which express the distorting influence of the medium. When it is so derivable, the particular in question may be regarded as caused by the regular appearances, and therefore by the object itself, together with the modifications resulting from the medium. In other cases, the particular in question may, in the same sense, be regarded as caused by several objects together with the medium; in this case, it may be called a confused appearance of several objects. If it happens to be in a brain, it may be called a confused perception of these objects. All actual perception is confused to a greater or less extent. We can now interpret in terms of our theory the distinction between those mental occurrences which are said to have an external stimulus, and those which are said to be ""centrally excited,"" i.e. to have no stimulus external to the brain. When a mental occurrence can be regarded as an appearance of an object external to the brain, however irregular, or even as a confused appearance of several such objects, then we may regard it as having for its stimulus the object or objects in question, or their appearances at the sense-organ concerned.",0,0,2.7125428e-05,Human,Human
"Under Socialism, there will be no one with private means, and if there is to be no loss as regards art and science, the opportunity which now comes by accident to a few will have to be provided deliberately for a much larger number. The men who have used private means as an opportunity for creative work have been few but important: one might mention Milton, Shelley, Keats and Darwin as examples. Probably none of these would have produced as good work if they had had to earn their livelihood. If Darwin had been a university teacher, he would of course have been dismissed from his post by the influence of the clerics on account of his scandalous theories. Nevertheless, the bulk of the creative work of the world is done at present by men who subsist by some other occupation. Science, and research generally, are usually done in their spare time by men who live by teaching. There is no great objection to this in the case of science, provided the number of hours devoted to teaching is not excessive. It is partly because science and teaching are so easily combined that science is vigorous in the present age. In music, a composer who is also a performer enjoys similar advantages, but one who is not a performer must starve, unless he is rich or willing to pander to the public taste. In the fine arts, as a rule, it is not easy in the modern world either to make a living by really good work or to find a subsidiary profession which leaves enough leisure for creation. This is presumably one reason, though by no means the only one, why art is less flourishing than science. The bureaucratic State Socialist will have a simple solution for these difficulties.",0,0,1.5154115e-05,Human,Human
"We are, of course, in fact able to judge, when we recognize an object, that we have seen it before, but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word. There is, however, another sense of the word, in which we mean by recognition, not knowing the name of a thing or some other property of it, but knowing that we have seen it before In this sense recognition does involve knowledge about the Fast. This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not. It does not involve a definite memory of a definite past event, but only the knowledge that something happening now is similar to something that happened before. It differs from the sense of familiarity by being cognitive; it is a belief or judgment, which the sense of familiarity is not. I do not wish to undertake the analysis of belief at present, since it will be the subject of the twelfth lecture; for the present I merely wish to emphasize the fact that recognition, in our second sense, consists in a belief, which we may express approximately in the words: ""This has existed before."" There are, however, several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate. To begin with, it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as ""I have seen this before"" than as ""this has existed before."" We recognize a thing (it may be urged) as having been in our experience before, whatever that may mean; we do not recognize it as merely having been in the world before.",0,0,1.701973e-05,Human,Human
"And for older boys and girls whose interests are not intellectual or artistic, technical education, undertaken in a liberal spirit, is far more useful in promoting mental activity than book-learning which they regard (however falsely) as wholly useless except for purposes of examination. The really useful educa- tion is that which follows the direction of the child's own instinctive interests, supplying knowledge for which it is seeking, not dry, detailed information wholly out of relation to its spontaneous desires. Some may fear that the result would be an undue increase of population, but such fears I believe to be groundless. See above, (Chapter IV, on ``Work and Pay.'' Also, Chapter vi of ``Principles of Social Reconstruction'' (George Allen and Unwin, Ltd.). Government and law will still exist in our community, but both will be reduced to a minimum. There will still be acts which will be forbidden--for example, murder. But very nearly the whole of that part of the criminal law which deals with property will have become obsolete, and many of the motives which now produce murders will be no longer operative. Those who nevertheless still do commit crimes will not be blamed or regarded as wicked; they will be regarded as unfortunate, and kept in some kind of mental hospital until it is thought that they are no longer a danger. By education and freedom and the abolition of private capital the number of crimes can be made exceedingly small. By the method of individual curative treatment it will generally be possible to secure that a man's first offense shall also be his last, except in the case of lunatics and the feeble-minded, for whom of course a more prolonged but not less kindly detention may be necessary.",0,0,1.02992035e-05,Human,Human
"No one would assert that people ought not to put into their mode of life, and into the conduct of their concerns, any impress whatever of their own judgment, or of their own individual character. On the other hand, it would be absurd to pretend that people ought to live as if nothing whatever had been known in the world before they came into it; as if experience had as yet done nothing towards showing that one mode of existence, or of conduct, is preferable to another. Nobody denies that people should be so taught and trained in youth, as to know and benefit by the ascertained results of human experience. But it is the privilege and proper condition of a human being, arrived at the maturity of his faculties, to use and interpret experience in his own way. It is for him to find out what part of recorded experience is properly applicable to his own circumstances and character. The traditions and customs of other people are, to a certain extent, evidence of what their experience has taught _them_; presumptive evidence, and as such, have a claim to his deference: but, in the first place, their experience may be too narrow; or they may not have interpreted it rightly. Secondly, their interpretation of experience may be correct, but unsuitable to him. Customs are made for customary circumstances, and customary characters: and his circumstances or his character may be uncustomary. Thirdly, though the customs be both good as customs, and suitable to him, yet to conform to custom, merely _as_ custom, does not educate or develop in him any of the qualities which are the distinctive endowment of a human being.",0,0,3.1017324e-05,Human,Human
"""Now Dr. and Mrs. Peckham have shown that the sting of the wasp is NOT UNERRING, as Fabre alleges, that the number of stings is NOT CONSTANT, that sometimes the caterpillar is NOT PARALYZED, and sometimes it is KILLED OUTRIGHT, and that THE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT APPARENTLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE LARVA, which is not injured by slight movements of the caterpillar, nor by consuming food decomposed rather than fresh caterpillar."" This illustrates how love of the marvellous may mislead even so careful an observer as Fabre and so eminent a philosopher as Bergson. In the same chapter of Dr. Drever's book there are some interesting examples of the mistakes made by instinct. I will quote one as a sample: ""The larva of the Lomechusa beetle eats the young of the ants, in whose nest it is reared. Nevertheless, the ants tend the Lomechusa larvae with the same care they bestow on their own young. Not only so, but they apparently discover that the methods of feeding, which suit their own larvae, would prove fatal to the guests, and accordingly they change their whole system of nursing"" (loc. 207-9) gives a good illustration of an instinct growing wiser through experience. He relates how hunters attract stags by imitating the sounds of other members of their species, male or female, but find that the older a stag becomes the more difficult it is to deceive him, and the more accurate the imitation has to be.

"The scientific study of this subject may almost be said to begin with Thorndike's ""Animal Intelligence"" (Macmillan, 1911). 262-3) has an ingenious theory as to the way in which habit arises out of random movements. I think there is a reason why his theory cannot be regarded as alone sufficient, but it seems not unlikely that it is partly correct. Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that there are just ten random movements which may be made by the animal--say, ten paths down which it may go--and that only one of these leads to food, or whatever else represents success in the case in question. Then the successful movement always occurs during the animal's attempts, whereas each of the others, on the average, occurs in only half the attempts. Thus the tendency to repeat a previous performance (which is easily explicable without the intervention of ""consciousness"") leads to a greater emphasis on the successful movement than on any other, and in time causes it alone to be performed. The objection to this view, if taken as the sole explanation, is that on improvement ought to set in till after the SECOND trial, whereas experiment shows that already at the second attempt the animal does better than the first time.",0,0,1.552997e-05,Human,Human
"There is the same need of an infallible judge of opinions to decide an opinion to be noxious, as to decide it to be false, unless the opinion condemned has full opportunity of defending itself. And it will not do to say that the heretic may be allowed to maintain the utility or harmlessness of his opinion, though forbidden to maintain its truth. The truth of an opinion is part of its utility. If we would know whether or not it is desirable that a proposition should be believed, is it possible to exclude the consideration of whether or not it is true? In the opinion, not of bad men, but of the best men, no belief which is contrary to truth can be really useful: and can you prevent such men from urging that plea, when they are charged with culpability for denying some doctrine which they are told is useful, but which they believe to be false? Those who are on the side of received opinions, never fail to take all possible advantage of this plea; you do not find _them_ handling the question of utility as if it could be completely abstracted from that of truth: on the contrary, it is, above all, because their doctrine is ""the truth,"" that the knowledge or the belief of it is held to be so indispensable. There can be no fair discussion of the question of usefulness, when an argument so vital may be employed on one side, but not on the other.

"But the power which consists in persuasion, in teaching, in leading men to a new wisdom or the realization of new possibilities of happiness--this kind of power, which may be wholly beneficial, would remain untouched, and many vigorous men, who in the actual world devote their energies to domination, would in such a world find their energies directed to the creation of new goods rather than the perpetuation of ancient evils. Envy, the third of the psychological causes to which we attributed what is bad in the actual world, depends in most natures upon that kind of fundamental discontent which springs from a lack of free development, from thwarted instinct, and from the impossibility of realizing an imagined happiness. Envy cannot be cured by preaching; preaching, at the best, will only alter its manifestations and lead it to adopt more subtle forms of concealment. Except in those rare natures in which generosity dominates in spite of circumstances, the only cure for envy is freedom and the joy of life. From populations largely deprived of the simple instinctive pleasures of leisure and love, sunshine and green fields, generosity of outlook and kindliness of dispositions are hardly to be expected. In such populations these qualities are not likely to be found, even among the fortunate few, for these few are aware, however dimly, that they are profiting by an injustice, and that they can only continue to enjoy their good fortune by deliberately ignoring those with whom it is not shared. If generosity and kindliness are to be common, there must be more care than there is at present for the elementary wants of human nature, and more realization that the diffusion of happiness among all who are not the victims of some peculiar misfortune is both possible and imperative.",0,0,0.00011014217,Human,Human
"The only human relations that have value are those that are rooted in mutual freedom, where there is no domination and no slavery, no tie except affection, no economic or conventional necessity to preserve the external show when the inner life is dead. One of the most horrible things about commercialism is the way in which it poisons the relations of men and women. The evils of prostitution are generally recognized, but, great as they are, the effect of economic conditions on marriage seems to me even worse. There is not infrequently, in marriage, a suggestion of purchase, of acquiring a woman on condition of keeping her in a certain standard of material comfort. Often and often, a marriage hardly differs from prostitution except by being harder to escape from. The whole basis of these evils is economic. Economic causes make marriage a matter of bargain and contract, in which affection is quite secondary, and its absence constitutes no recognized reason for liberation. Marriage should be a free, spontaneous meeting of mutual instinct, filled with happiness not unmixed with a feeling akin to awe: it should involve that degree of respect of each for the other that makes even the most trifling interference with liberty an utter impossibility, and a common life enforced by one against the will of the other an unthinkable thing of deep horror.

"I grant that the wife, if she cannot effectually resist, can at least retaliate; she, too, can make the man's life extremely uncomfortable, and by that power is able to carry many points which she ought, and many which she ought not, to prevail in. But this instrument of self-protection--which may be called the power of the scold, or the shrewish sanction--has the fatal defect, that it avails most against the least tyrannical superiors, and in favour of the least deserving dependents. It is the weapon of irritable and self-willed women; of those who would make the worst use of power if they themselves had it, and who generally turn this power to a bad use. The amiable cannot use such an instrument, the highminded disdain it. And on the other hand, the husbands against whom it is used most effectively are the gentler and more inoffensive; those who cannot be induced, even by provocation, to resort to any very harsh exercise of authority. The wife's power of being disagreeable generally only establishes a counter-tyranny, and makes victims in their turn chiefly of those husbands who are least inclined to be tyrants. What is it, then, which really tempers the corrupting effects of the power, and makes it compatible with such amount of good as we actually see?",0,0,3.9101484e-05,Human,Human
"This is one great reason why the communal ownership of land and capital would be likely to have a beneficial effect upon human nature, for human nature, as it exists in adult men and women, is by no means a fixed datum, but a product of circumstances, education and opportunity operating upon a highly malleable native disposition. What is true of competitiveness is equally true of love of power. Power, in the form in which it is now usually sought, is power of command, power of imposing one's will upon others by force, open or concealed. This form of power consists, in essence, in thwarting others, for it is only displayed when others are compelled to do what they do not wish to do. Such power, we hope, the social system which is to supersede capitalist will reduce to a minimum by the methods which we outlined in the preceding chapter. These methods can be applied in international no less than in national affairs. In international affairs the same formula of federalism will apply: self- determination for every group in regard to matters which concern it much more vitally than they concern others, and government by a neutral authority embracing rival groups in all matters in which conflicting interests of groups come into play; lout always with the fixed principle that the functions of government are to be reduced to the bare minimum compatible with justice and the prevention of private violence. In such a world the present harmful outlets for the love of power would be closed.",0,0,7.651113e-05,Human,Human
"On the other hand, a movement is ""learnt,"" or embodies a ""habit,"" if it is due to previous experience of similar situations, and is not what it would be if the animal had had no such experience. There are various complications which blur the sharpness of this distinction in practice. To begin with, many instincts mature gradually, and while they are immature an animal may act in a fumbling manner which is very difficult to distinguish from learning. James (""Psychology,"" ii, 407) maintains that children walk by instinct, and that the awkwardness of their first attempts is only due to the fact that the instinct has not yet ripened. He hopes that ""some scientific widower, left alone with his offspring at the critical moment, may ere long test this suggestion on the living subject."" However this may be, he quotes evidence to show that ""birds do not LEARN to fly,"" but fly by instinct when they reach the appropriate age (ib., p. 406). In the second place, instinct often gives only a rough outline of the sort of thing to do, in which case learning is necessary in order to acquire certainty and precision in action. In the third place, even in the clearest cases of acquired habit, such as speaking, some instinct is required to set in motion the process of learning. In the case of speaking, the chief instinct involved is commonly supposed to be that of imitation, but this may be questioned. In spite of these qualifications, the broad distinction between instinct and habit is undeniable.",0,0,7.619027e-05,Human,Human
"Even despotism does not produce its worst effects, so long as Individuality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name it may be called, and whether it professes to be enforcing the will of God or the injunctions of men. Having said that Individuality is the same thing with development, and that it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces, or can produce, well-developed human beings, I might here close the argument: for what more or better can be said of any condition of human affairs, than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thing they can be?

or what worse can be said of any obstruction to good, than that it prevents this? Doubtless, however, these considerations will not suffice to convince those who most need convincing; and it is necessary further to show, that these developed human beings are of some use to the undeveloped--to point out to those who do not desire liberty, and would not avail themselves of it, that they may be in some intelligible manner rewarded for allowing other people to make use of it without hindrance. In the first place, then, I would suggest that they might possibly learn something from them. It will not be denied by anybody, that originality is a valuable element in human affairs. There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths, and point out when what were once truths are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, and set the example of more enlightened conduct, and better taste and sense in human life. This cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does not believe that the world has already attained perfection in all its ways and practices.",0,0,1.6186965e-05,Human,Human
"When Simon de Montfort called the deputies of the commons to sit for the first time in Parliament, did any of them dream of demanding that an assembly, elected by their constituents, should make and destroy ministries, and dictate to the king in affairs of state? No such thought entered into the imagination of the most ambitious of them. The nobility had already these pretensions; the commons pretended to nothing but to be exempt from arbitrary taxation, and from the gross individual oppression of the king's officers. It is a political law of nature that those who are under any power of ancient origin, never begin by complaining of the power itself, but only of its oppressive exercise. There is never any want of women who complain of ill usage by their husbands. There would be infinitely more, if complaint were not the greatest of all provocatives to a repetition and increase of the ill usage. It is this which frustrates all attempts to maintain the power but protect the woman against its abuses. In no other case (except that of a child) is the person who has been proved judicially to have suffered an injury, replaced under the physical power of the culprit who inflicted it. Accordingly wives, even in the most extreme and protracted cases of bodily ill usage, hardly ever dare avail themselves of the laws made for their protection: and if, in a moment of irrepressible indignation, or by the interference of neighbours, they are induced to do so, their whole effort afterwards is to disclose as little as they can, and to beg off their tyrant from his merited chastisement.

"The examination of class, Marx, syndicalism, and labor, as presented within the framework of Bertrand Russell's ""Proposed Roads to Freedom,"" necessitates a dissection of foundational concepts, their interrelationships, and the historical and philosophical underpinnings that inform Russell's vision. Russell, in this work, grapples with the pervasive influence of class divisions, the enduring legacy of Marx's critique of capitalism, the emergent ideology of syndicalism as a potential palliative, and the fundamental role of labor in any just societal arrangement. These elements are not discrete entities but rather interwoven threads in the fabric of societal organization, each profoundly impacting the others. At the core of this analysis lies the concept of **class**, understood as a stratification of society based on economic position and power. Marx provided the seminal framework for understanding class, positing a fundamental antagonism between the bourgeoisie, who own the means of production, and the proletariat, who possess only their labor power to sell. This division, according to Marx, is not merely an economic disparity but a structural feature of capitalism that generates inherent conflict. Russell, while not wholly adhering to every tenet of Marxism, certainly acknowledges the reality and the detrimental consequences of class. His concern is with how these divisions engender inequality, exploitation, and a vitiation of individual liberty. The mechanism through which class operates is the control over resources and the power derived from that control. The owning class, by virtue of its ownership, dictates terms of employment, wages, and working conditions, thereby exerting a profound influence over the lives and opportunities of the non-owning class. This creates a causal chain where economic power translates into social and political influence, perpetuating the existing class structure.",1,1,0.99998415,AI,AI
"This mechanism operates not through overt acts of oppression in every instance, but through the pervasive apprehension by women themselves of their circumscribed sphere, inculcated from infancy through education, social expectation, and the absence of viable alternatives. The consequence is a profound enervation of individual potential, where natural aptitudes, if not conforming to a narrowly prescribed domestic role, are either suppressed, diverted, or simply never discovered. The purported ""nature"" of women, so frequently cited as the justification for their subjection, is thus revealed by Mill as a mere artifact of their artificial cultivation, the coerced product of circumstances rather than an inherent datum of biology or psychology. Conversely, the role of ""men"" in this established order, while seemingly one of unalloyed privilege, carries its own intricate implications and indeed its own debasements. The legal and customary ascendancy of men over women invests them with a quasi-despotic power within the domestic sphere, a situation entirely alien to the principles of liberty and equality championed in the public domain. This authority, though it may not always manifest as conscious tyranny, nevertheless establishes a dynamic where one party is accustomed to command and the other to obey. The underlying mechanism here is the psychological effect of habitual power: it tends to corrupt, not merely in its exercise, but in the very character of the one who wields it. Mill argues that the domestic despotism permitted to men fosters a type of self-importance and an insensitivity to the feelings and perspectives of others that would be deemed unacceptable in any other context. This paternalistic, yet fundamentally unequal, relationship within marriage, which Mill scathingly compares to slavery, inhibits the development of a truly reciprocal and ennobling partnership.",1,1,0.99999297,AI,AI
"As sensations fade, they leave behind images—mental echoes that persist after the physical stimulus has vanished. These images are the building blocks of thought and the medium through which the past is reconstructed. However, the palette of images available to an individual is largely a product of social and institutional environments. The architectural design of cities, the visual language of mass media, and the curricula of educational institutions provide the primary source material for these internal images. A person’s mental landscape is populated by images that reflect the social structures they inhabit. These images serve as internal templates that guide behavior. For instance, an individual’s image of ""authority"" or ""order"" is not an innate mental construct but a reflection of the institutional symbols they have encountered, such as uniforms, courtrooms, or corporate boardrooms. These images act as internal regulators, shaping character by aligning individual imagination with social reality. The transition from images to memory involves the addition of a specific ""feeling of pastness"" and a belief in the continuity of the self. Memory is not merely a psychological faculty but a vital component of legal and social systems. The legal structure, in particular, is predicated on the reliability and linearity of memory. Contracts, testimonies, and the assignment of criminal responsibility depend on the individual’s ability to maintain a coherent narrative of their past actions. This institutional requirement for a stable memory forces a specific organization of the individual’s internal life. To be a ""person"" in the eyes of the law is to be an entity capable of recalling and accounting for past sensations and images in a manner that satisfies evidentiary standards.",1,1,0.9999943,AI,AI
"The long-term consequences range from the perpetuation of existing hierarchies to radical societal transformations, depending on the efficacy of the causal chains and the nature of the responses they elicit. END

In the complex tapestry of societal organization, the concepts of class, Marxism, syndicalism, and labor represent interconnected forces that shape the distribution of power, resources, and opportunities. Examining these elements from a system-level perspective reveals how they interact within institutional, legal, and social structures, profoundly influencing individual behavior and character. These structures, in turn, are not static but are constantly being molded by the very forces they are designed to contain or promote. Class, fundamentally, refers to stratification within society based on economic standing and relationship to the means of production. In a system-level view, class is not merely an individual attribute but a pervasive organizing principle. It establishes distinct institutional roles and expectations. For instance, within capitalist systems, the institution of private ownership of capital inherently creates a class of owners (bourgeoisie) and a class of laborers (proletariat). This division manifests in distinct legal frameworks, such as property law, contract law, and labor law, which often reflect and reinforce existing class relations. The legal rights and obligations of an employer differ significantly from those of an employee, shaping their interactions within the workplace institution. Socially, class influences access to education, healthcare, and housing, creating divergent life trajectories and shaping the very character and aspirations of individuals. A child born into a family of means may experience a different educational system, fostering skills and dispositions valued by the dominant class, whereas a child from a working-class background might face limited opportunities, potentially cultivating resilience and solidarity born from shared hardship, but also potentially instilling a sense of fatalism or resignation.",1,1,0.9999937,AI,AI
"This form of power often operates through institutions like education, media, and religious doctrines. Finally, ""psychological"" or ""emotional power"" can arise from dependency, strong emotional bonds, or internalized beliefs about one's own limitations or proper role, leading individuals to accept or even desire their subjection. The distribution of power within a society, particularly between groups like women and men, is therefore not accidental but the result of historical processes and ongoing social mechanisms, often designed to maintain existing hierarchies. A critical assumption is that power, especially when concentrated or unjustly exercised, can lead to the ""subjection"" of one group by another, fundamentally restricting liberty and individual agency. The conceptual meaning of ""women_men_society_power"" crystallizes in their dynamic and often conflictual interrelationships. Society, through its customs, laws, and power structures, plays the primary role in *defining* what it means to be a ""woman"" or a ""man"" beyond biological fact. It prescribes roles, limits opportunities, and shapes perceived aptitudes, largely dictating the trajectory of individual lives. The relationship between women and men, far from being one of simple equality or natural complementarity, has historically been characterized by a pervasive power imbalance, with men generally holding a disproportionate share of legal, social, economic, and ideological power. This imbalance is not merely a collection of individual injustices but a systemic pattern, deeply embedded in social structures. Custom, in this context, emerges as a particularly powerful agent in maintaining these gendered power dynamics. Many forms of male dominance are not primarily based on explicit legislative decree but on deeply ingrained custom, which operates with the force of unwritten law. These customs are frequently rationalized by appeals to ""nature,"" ""ancient wisdom,"" or expediency, serving to legitimate a status quo where women's roles are circumscribed and their autonomy curtailed.",1,1,0.99999344,AI,AI
"The intricate relationship between the concepts of ""human,"" ""power,"" ""men,"" and ""character"" forms a fundamental analytical framework for understanding the historical
development of social structures and individual identities. These terms are not fixed or universally defined but are instead deeply contingent upon historical context, 
societal organization, and the distribution of authority. A systematic exploration reveals how definitions of humanity have been historically circumscribed, how power 
has been allocated, how the identity of ""men"" has been socially constructed, and how individual character has been molded under these prevailing conditions. To begin, the concept of ""human"" itself has not always been universally applied in its fullest sense. While biologically all individuals belong to the human species,
the *recognition* of full humanity, entailing autonomy, rationality, and the right to self-development, has historically been selectively bestowed. For extensive
periods, prevailing philosophical and social frameworks delineated humanity not merely by species membership, but by the capacity for reason, civic participation,
and economic independence. These criteria, whether explicitly or implicitly, often served to distinguish between those deemed fully capable of self-governance 
and public life, and those relegated to a lesser, often dependent, status. This demarcation frequently operated along lines of social status, race, and, 
critically, sex. The prevailing view often posited one sex as the archetype of full human rationality and competence, with the other being defined in relation to,
or as a complement to, this archetype. This historical differentiation meant that the inherent capacities and potential of all individuals were not uniformly 
acknowledged, leading to a circumscribed understanding of what it meant to be a fully recognized ""human"" being within the social and political sphere. The 
implications of this selective definition extended profoundly into all aspects of life, from legal standing to educational opportunity and social expectation.",1,1,0.9999882,AI,AI
"The legal structures supporting such guilds would need to define their powers, responsibilities, and their relationship to other societal bodies. Socially, this could foster a sense of collective responsibility and pride in craftsmanship, as individuals feel a more direct connection to the output of their efforts and its impact on the community. The legal framework for industrial guilds would need to establish mechanisms for internal governance, worker representation, and accountability. The role of the ""state"" is perhaps the most contentious element in these proposed roads to freedom. While some socialist visions envision a greatly diminished state, others see it as a necessary coordinating mechanism. In Guild Socialism, for example, the state, represented by a territorial parliament, would retain a role in areas such as public health, education, and foreign policy, while industrial matters would be largely managed by the guilds. A separate ""Guild Congress,"" composed of representatives from the guilds, would handle issues pertaining to production, thereby creating a dual structure of governance. The legal implications of such a dual system are considerable, requiring a careful delineation of powers between the territorial state and the industrial guilds. Socially, this division of authority aims to prevent any single entity from accumulating excessive power. By separating political representation from industrial control, the individual is theoretically shielded from the absolute dominion of either the state or an unchecked capitalist class. The legal structures would need to define the precise boundaries of jurisdiction for each body, ensuring that the rights and freedoms of individuals are protected across both spheres of influence. Consider the impact on individual behavior and character. In a society where economic security is a given, and the relentless pressure to compete for survival and accumulation is removed, the character of individuals is likely to be shaped in fundamentally different ways.",1,1,0.99997926,AI,AI
"When economic structures create vast inequalities or restrict access to essential resources, they can limit individuals’ capacity to make meaningful choices about their lives, thereby indirectly curtailing their liberty. The direction of influence here is often indirect, as economic conditions shape the choices and opportunities available to individuals. For example, poverty can severely limit an individual’s freedom to pursue education, engage in political discourse, or even express themselves without fear of repercussions related to their basic survival. The long-term consequences of institutional arrangements that support and expand liberty are a society characterized by innovation, economic prosperity, and a high degree of individual well-being. Conversely, institutions that stifle liberty can lead to stagnation, social stratification, and a decline in overall societal health and dynamism. In summation, the causal structure underlying societal structures, individual liberties, and human conduct is a dynamic and reciprocal one. Social norms create expectations for behavior, influencing individuals to conform or to deviate, with consequences for both their psychological well-being and their perception of freedom. Psychological needs for self-expression and intellectual development are nurtured or stifled by the degree of liberty afforded, impacting an individual’s capacity for critical thought and personal fulfillment. Legal frameworks provide the formal mechanisms for protecting or restricting liberty, employing coercion as an intermediate tool to shape conduct, with long-term outcomes ranging from societal empowerment to repression. Finally, institutional arrangements, from governance to education and economics, create the broader context within which liberty is exercised, influencing individual opportunities and shaping the collective trajectory of society. The persistent interplay of these factors dictates the extent to which individuals can chart their own courses and the resulting character of the societies they inhabit.",1,1,0.9999907,AI,AI
"Society has no business dictating how individuals ought to live their lives as long as their conduct does not infringe upon the distinct interests or rights of others. This distinction between self-regarding and other-regarding conduct is crucial. Actions that primarily affect only the individual agent are deemed to be within the sphere of legitimate personal liberty, free from social or legal sanction. The agent is sovereign over their own body and mind. Conversely, actions that directly cause harm to others – infringing on their security, property, or well-being – fall within the domain of societal regulation. The underlying mechanism here is a form of social contract, not necessarily explicit, but resting on the recognition that living in a community entails certain reciprocal obligations, primarily the duty not to injure others. The concept of ""harm"" within this framework is not amorphous; it refers to direct, tangible injury to the interests of others, typically those interests that society, by general agreement, ought to consider as rights. It does not encompass mere offense, disapproval, or moral indignation felt by others regarding an individual's choices or lifestyle. For instance, society may disapprove of certain personal habits or choices, but unless those choices directly and concretely cause harm to identifiable others, they remain outside the legitimate scope of collective intervention. This precision in defining harm is essential to prevent the principle from being subverted by subjective moral judgments or the sensibilities of the majority, which would effectively re-establish the very tyranny it seeks to prevent. The causal chain here is direct: legitimate social intervention stems from demonstrable harm to others, protecting a sphere of individual conduct from arbitrary moral policing.",1,1,0.99998176,AI,AI
"At its core, this phrase describes a hypothetical societal arrangement where the means of production are collectively owned and controlled by the state, and the primary mode of individual contribution to society is through waged labor within this state-controlled framework. To understand this concept, we must define and distinguish several key terms: ""work,"" ""socialism,"" ""state,"" and crucially, the notion of ""present"" as it modifies the application of these terms. The term ""work"" itself, in this context, moves beyond mere activity or exertion. It signifies productive labor, the application of human effort to create goods and services that are then distributed within the society. This definition implicitly assumes a functional economy where production is necessary for survival and societal well-being. Russell, and by extension the concept we are analyzing, presumes that a society requires organized effort to sustain itself. The ""work"" in question is therefore not abstract but concrete, tied to tangible outputs. It is inherently social in its orientation, meaning it is performed not solely for personal immediate gratification but for the benefit of the collective, even if that benefit is mediated through wages. The constraint on this concept of work is its structured and often specialized nature within a planned economy, moving away from purely artisanal or self-sufficient labor towards an organized system of tasks assigned and managed by the state. ""Socialism"" is the overarching ideological and economic system within which this model of work operates. Conceptually, socialism signifies a departure from private ownership of the means of production (land, factories, machinery, etc.). Instead, these are held in common or collectively. In the context of ""work_present_socialism_state,"" this collective ownership is specifically embodied by the ""state."" This implies a central authority responsible for managing, organizing, and directing economic activity.",1,1,0.99998796,AI,AI
"The intricate relationship between society, liberty, and human conduct forms a perennial subject of philosophical inquiry, central to understanding the nature of collective life and individual flourishing. This inquiry confronts the fundamental tension between the authority of the collective and the autonomy of the individual, seeking to delineate the legitimate boundaries of social control over personal action and thought. The problem is not merely about the state's power, but extends to the pervasive influence of custom, public opinion, and the myriad informal pressures exerted by the community on its members. Navigating this complex interplay requires a systematic examination of the components at work, the mechanisms through which they interact, and the profound implications of their configuration for both individual development and societal progress. At its core, liberty, in this context, extends beyond mere political freedom from governmental oppression; it encompasses social liberty – the freedom to think, speak, and act according to one's own judgment, unhindered by the collective will, unless such actions directly imperil others. This conception rests on the premise that human beings are rational agents capable of making choices about their own lives and pursuing their own conceptions of a good existence. The freedom of thought and expression stands as the most fundamental aspect of this liberty. It is not merely the right to hold one's opinions privately, but crucially, the freedom to articulate them, to discuss them openly, and to challenge prevailing dogmas. The mechanism underlying this emphasis is the belief that truth is not static or easily discernible, but emerges through a vigorous contest of ideas. Even a false opinion, when openly debated, serves a vital function, either by clarifying and invigorating true beliefs or by revealing its own errors, thus contributing to a deeper understanding.",1,1,0.9999932,AI,AI
"The ""mnemic causation"" that links them is the unique feature of the psychological realm, allowing the past to persist in the present through the medium of the image. This persistent influence of the past is what transforms a mere sequence of physical events into a psychological ""biography. ""

To attain conceptual clarity, one must resist the urge to see ""the mind"" as a separate entity that ""has"" memories or ""sees"" images. Instead, the mind is the collection of these sensations, images, and feelings. The ""subject"" is not a mystical observer but a name for the way these events are grouped together according to the laws of mnemic causation. This requires a shift in how we understand ""knowledge"" of the past. Knowledge is not a direct grasp of a bygone moment, but a present alignment of an image and a belief that happens to correspond to a past sensation. The precision of these definitions serves to strip away the metaphysical baggage often associated with consciousness. By defining memory as a complex of present feelings and images, the framework brings the study of the past into the realm of observable psychological phenomena. It acknowledges that while the past is gone, its effects remain in the structure of the organism, manifesting as the ""mnemic"" power to produce images and feelings of familiarity. The distinction between the image and the sensation remains the most important boundary, as it separates the world of physics (the sensation as a physical event) from the world of psychology (the image as a mnemic event). Ultimately, the conceptual meaning of these terms hinges on their placement within a causal system. Sensations are defined by their physical causes, images by their mnemic causes, and memories by the specific subjective feelings that accompany images.",1,1,0.99998844,AI,AI
"Implicit in his usage is the assumption that economic ownership directly translates into political and social influence, creating systemic inequalities. Conceptual distinctions are crucial here: Russell differentiates between an **objective** class position (defined by ownership or lack thereof) and a **subjective** class consciousness (the awareness of one's class interests). While Marx emphasizes the revolutionary potential of developing class consciousness, Russell is more concerned with the practical consequences of class division on individual liberty and the potential for cooperation. His exploration is constrained by the historical context of early 20th-century industrial capitalism, where these divisions were starkly apparent. The relationship between class and other concepts is direct: the analysis of class informs the critique of capitalism and the proposed alternatives. Syndicalism, for instance, emerges as a response to the perceived injustices of class-based exploitation. Labor, as a category of human activity and a source of value, is central to defining class relations. **Marx** himself, as a theoretical framework, provides a foundational lens through which Russell examines the existing social order. Russell does not engage with Marxism as a monolithic dogma but rather as a powerful intellectual tool for understanding historical development and economic forces. Key terms associated with Marx in Russell's context include **historical materialism**, the **dialectic**, **exploitation**, and **surplus value**. The implicit assumption underlying Russell's engagement with Marx is that historical change is driven by material conditions and economic structures. The dialectical method, though not always explicitly articulated by Russell, informs his understanding of the contradictions within capitalism that necessitate social change. Russell accepts Marx's analysis of exploitation – the extraction of unpaid labor from the worker by the capitalist – as a core problem of capitalist production.",1,1,0.9999827,AI,AI
"The ""nature"" of women, in this view, has never been truly known, having always been overlaid and obscured by the artificial constraints imposed by a patriarchal society. The freeing of human potential requires a dismantling of these artificial barriers and a commitment to empirical observation and rational analysis to determine true differences, if any. The role of reason is paramount in this framework. It implies a belief that social arrangements, especially those involving power, rights, and liberty, should not be immune to rational scrutiny. If customs, traditions, or laws cannot withstand a rigorous, evidence-based justification that aligns with principles of liberty and utility, they ought to be reformed. Appeals to mere tradition or sentiment are deemed insufficient grounds for maintaining systems of inequality. Consequently, access to education and the cultivation of intellectual faculties are presented as indispensable means for women to realize their potential, challenge prevailing assumptions, and acquire the capacity for self-governance and full participation in society. In conclusion, the conceptual understanding of women, men, society, and power is neither simple nor static. It requires a nuanced appreciation of how biological sex is differentiated from socially constructed gender, how custom and institutions within society powerfully shape individual lives, and how multifaceted power dynamics profoundly influence the relationships between groups. The concept of subjection emerges as a specific manifestation of an unequal distribution of power, severely curtailing liberty and agency, particularly for women. A precise grasp of these concepts demands a clear distinction between what is perceived as ""natural"" and what is demonstrably ""artificial,"" a recognition of the pervasive influence of ideology in legitimizing existing power structures, and a commitment to applying reason and utility as guiding principles for social reform.",1,1,0.9999912,AI,AI
"Educational systems were typically segregated, offering women a curriculum focused on domestic skills, accomplishments, and moral instruction, rather than rigorous academic or professional training, thereby limiting their intellectual development and future prospects. Economically, women were largely excluded from professions and higher-paying occupations, relegated to domestic service, needlework, or unpaid labor within the household, reinforcing their economic dependence. Politically, the right to vote, hold office, or participate in public decision-making was almost universally denied, effectively silencing half of the population. The underlying mechanism justifying this pervasive sex-based stratification was often the assertion that these distinctions were ""natural"" or even divinely ordained. This claim of naturalness served as a powerful legitimizing mechanism, cloaking what was, in essence, a product of historical convention, accumulated custom, and the exercise of power. It transformed a social construct into an immutable biological or metaphysical truth, thereby rendering any challenge to the status quo seemingly irrational or even impious. This historical inertia, driven by tradition rather than demonstrable utility or justice, solidified the existing order, making it appear self-evident and beyond question. The perpetuation of this system operated through several reinforcing mechanisms. From birth, individuals were subjected to intense processes of socialization and conditioning, wherein expectations regarding behavior, aspirations, and interests were rigidly shaped according to their assigned sex. Children learned their roles through parental guidance, peer pressure, educational content, and cultural narratives, leading to the internalization of these predefined norms. This constant reinforcement created self-fulfilling prophecies, where individuals, denied opportunities to develop certain faculties, were then cited as evidence of their inherent lack. For instance, if women were systematically denied advanced education in mathematics, their perceived deficiency in the field was then used to argue for their innate mathematical inferiority.",1,1,0.9999895,AI,AI
"The enduring question of the proper constitution of human society, particularly concerning the relations which obtain between its constituent parts, has seldom been approached with that dispassionate rigour and impartial inquiry which the gravest matters of public and private felicity demand. Among the most pervasive and least questioned of these relations has been the legal and social subordination of one half of the human species to the other, a condition which, when subjected to systematic analysis, reveals itself not as an immutable decree of nature, but as a vestige of primitive force, rendered more palatable by long custom and sentiment. It is within this analytical framework that John Stuart Mill, in *The Subjection of Women*, meticulously dissects the mechanisms by which ""women"" have been constrained by ""men"" in relation to ""things,"" thereby profoundly impeding the realization of human ""greatness. ""

The very notion of ""women"" within the societal structure, as delineated by Mill, is fundamentally defined by their status relative to ""men."" Historically, and indeed within the societal fabric of Mill's own era, ""women"" were largely subsumed under the legal personality of their husbands or fathers, their existence as independent moral and economic agents systematically effaced. This was not merely a matter of social convention, but of explicit legal codification, most notably through the doctrine of coverture, which effectively rendered the married woman a legal non-entity, her property, earnings, and even her children becoming the legal possession of her spouse. The underlying mechanism here is the ""law of the strongest,"" a principle of governance suited to barbaric ages, which, though long repudiated in the public sphere, continued to assert its dominion within the private relations of the sexes.",1,1,0.9999608,AI,AI
"The constraint on the ""state,"" in any form, is the inherent human propensity for both cooperation and conflict, and the difficulty of designing institutions that can effectively manage this duality. In sum, the proposed roads to freedom navigate a complex conceptual landscape where ""work,"" ""present,"" ""socialism,"" and ""state"" are not isolated phenomena but are deeply interwoven. The ""present"" order of capitalist exploitation, where work is often dehumanizing and the state serves to uphold this system, is the problem to be solved. ""Socialism"" offers a range of solutions by reconfiguring the organization and ownership of work, but these solutions are themselves constrained by the potential for new forms of oppression, particularly through the over-empowerment of the ""state."" The conceptual precision required lies in understanding that freedom is not merely the absence of external constraint but the presence of meaningful self-direction, and that the achievement of this requires a careful and nuanced approach to the organization of work, the distribution of power, and the role of collective institutions. END

The structure of work, as it presently obtains in our civilised world, and its intimate connection with the prevailing notions of property, the nascent stirrings of socialism, and the overarching power of the state, forms a complex and interwoven tapestry, the threads of which merit careful examination. In `Proposed Roads to Freedom`, my intention is not to present a utopian blueprint, but rather to dissect the causal mechanisms that shape our social and individual lives, and to consider how these might be reconfigured with a view to greater liberty and a more humane existence. Let us first consider the causal nexus surrounding `work`. The fundamental impetus for work, in the current societal arrangement, is overwhelmingly economic coercion.",1,1,0.9999895,AI,AI
"By rewarding certain behaviors and penalizing others, the institution shapes the individual’s ""character""—which, from a system-level perspective, is simply the sum of their behavioral habits. When an individual’s character is aligned with the needs of the social structure, the system operates with high efficiency and low friction. Legal structures represent the most formal and rigid level of systemic constraint. They function as a set of negative boundaries that define the outer limits of acceptable action. While social structures use soft power like peer pressure or cultural norms to shape desire, the legal system uses the threat of force or the deprivation of liberty to ensure that individual actions do not compromise the stability of the whole. However, the legal system also serves a deeper psychological function: it provides a predictable environment where the outcomes of actions can be anticipated. This predictability allows the individual to form complex, long-term desires that require sustained action, such as career building or wealth accumulation. Without the legal framework to protect the results of these actions, the human animal would likely revert to short-term, purely instinctive behavior focused on immediate survival. The interaction between the individual and the social level is perhaps the most fluid. Social structures consist of the shared beliefs, traditions, and informal hierarchies that govern daily life. These structures act as the medium through which institutional directives are translated into individual motivations. A law may prohibit theft, but it is the social structure that attaches a sense of shame or dishonor to the act, thereby influencing the individual’s internal experience of desire. This internalisation is crucial for the system’s longevity. If the constraints were purely external and institutional, the cost of monitoring and enforcement would be prohibitively high.",1,1,0.99999547,AI,AI
"This division of power is seen as a bulwark against despotism. Anarchism, representing the most radical departure from state control, seeks the complete abolition of the state. In its libertarian socialist variants, the focus is on the voluntary association of individuals and groups to organise production and social life. Work would be entirely self-directed, and collective decisions would be made through direct democracy or other forms of non-coercive consensus. While appealing in its absolute commitment to individual freedom, Russell acknowledges the practical challenges of implementing such a system on a large scale, particularly in ensuring the provision of essential services and defence against external threats without resorting to some form of organised authority. The historical context here is the long-standing philosophical debate concerning human nature and the necessity of government. Anarchists often hold a more optimistic view of human capacity for self-governance than those who see an inherent need for external enforcement mechanisms. The relationship between work and the state is thus a pivotal element in Russell’s proposed roads to freedom. A system that liberates individuals from the drudgery and insecurity of wage-labour, and reconfigures work as a more fulfilling and voluntary pursuit, is a prerequisite for genuine freedom. However, the means by which this liberation is achieved are of paramount importance. If the transition to a socialist society results in the creation of an even more powerful and intrusive state apparatus, then the fundamental objective of increased liberty will have been undermined. The historical tendency of states to expand their reach and control, coupled with the inherent dangers of unchecked authority, mandates a cautious and critical approach to any proposed solutions that rely heavily on state power.",1,1,0.9999838,AI,AI
"It does not possess the ""mnemic"" quality—the dependence on past experience—that characterizes more complex mental states. From the bedrock of sensation, we move to the concept of the image. Images are described as ""ghosts"" of sensations. They are similar to sensations in their qualitative content—an image of a blue patch resembles a sensation of a blue patch—but they differ in their causal origins and their felt intensity. While a sensation is tied to a present external stimulus, an image is a ""mnemic"" phenomenon. It arises not because an object is currently affecting the sense organs, but because of the residue of past sensations. This introduces a fundamental conceptual distinction: the difference between physical causation and mnemic causation. Physical causation follows the laws of inertia and energy transfer, whereas mnemic causation allows the past to influence the present directly through the medium of the organism. Images are the primary vehicle of this mnemic influence. The relationship between sensations and images is one of ""prototype"" and ""copy."" An image is essentially a representation of a sensation that occurred previously. However, images are not merely weaker sensations. They are qualified by a lack of the ""vividness"" and ""externality"" that sensations possess. A sensation has a certain ""force"" or ""compulsion"" that an image lacks. Furthermore, images belong exclusively to the realm of psychology and the ""biography"" of the individual. While two people can be said to see the same physical object (resulting in two similar sensations), the images that arise in their minds afterward are private and internal. They are the materials from which the internal life of the mind is constructed. The transition from images to memory requires the introduction of several more complex conceptual layers.",1,1,0.99997187,AI,AI
"The ideal human is an autonomous agent, capable of making reasoned choices, taking responsibility for their actions, and contributing meaningfully to the larger social fabric. Implicit in this definition is the assumption of a shared human nature that transcends superficial differences, making universal principles of justice and liberty applicable to all. Any social order that fails to cultivate the full humanity of all its members is, by definition, suboptimal and unjust. Complementing the concept of the human is **power**, understood as the capacity to influence or control the actions, opportunities, or will of others, or to shape social structures and outcomes. Power manifests in various forms: as legitimate authority derived from consent, law, or expertise, exercised for the common good; or as illegitimate domination, based on force, custom, or arbitrary privilege. The distinction between these forms is critical. Legitimate power is seen as a necessary instrument for social coordination and protection, safeguarding individual liberties and facilitating collective endeavors. It is exercised with accountability and is subject to rational justification. Conversely, illegitimate power represents a form of coercion that undermines individual autonomy and distorts social relations. When power is concentrated in the hands of one group over another, especially without a basis in demonstrated merit or a clear societal benefit, it becomes a source of oppression and injustice. Such power structures often operate through institutionalized norms, legal frameworks, and prevailing social customs, becoming deeply entrenched and difficult to dislodge. The exercise of illegitimate power is inherently exploitative, benefiting the powerful at the expense of the subjugated, and preventing the latter from realizing their full human potential. The philosophical concern with power, therefore, is not its mere existence, but its distribution, its basis, and its effects on individual liberty and collective well-being.",1,1,0.9999912,AI,AI
"It is not merely the aggregate sum of individuals comprising a community, but rather a complex, organised, and largely self-regulating body, imbued with a distinct character and possessing mechanisms, both formal and informal, for shaping the lives of its members. Society manifests itself most overtly through its laws and its magistrates, who enforce those laws by means of physical coercion. However, and perhaps more insidiously, society’s influence extends far beyond these juridical bounds, asserting itself through the potent, though often diffuse, instrument of public opinion, along with the settled customs, traditions, and habits of thought that permeate its collective consciousness. This latter manifestation, often termed ""the moral coercion of public opinion,"" constitutes, in Mill's estimation, a form of tyranny no less oppressive than that which emanates from political rulers, indeed, in certain respects, more pervasive, as it reaches into every sphere of life, ""enslaving the soul itself. ""

The implicit assumption here is that society, left unchecked, tends towards a collective mediocrity, a uniformisation of character and thought, which, whilst perhaps ensuring a certain orderliness, ultimately stifles the very sources of its own progressive advancement. Society thus conceived, for all its undeniable utility in establishing order and security, is simultaneously portrayed as a potential leviathan, prone to overreach, to impose its particular standards of life and conduct upon those who might incline to diverge from the established norm. It demands conformity, not merely in matters affecting the safety and well-being of others, but in the realm of tastes, pursuits, and even personal beliefs, thus tending to ""pinch and dwarf human beings.""",1,1,0.9999827,AI,AI
"The habits of command, so often observed in those in positions of authority, are not solely a product of inherent authoritarianism but are also cultivated by institutional roles that grant power and influence, reinforcing the very desire to command. The social structure, through its myriad forms of reward and punishment, plays a crucial role in shaping not just specific actions but the underlying character. A society that rewards conformity and obedience may foster individuals who are less inclined towards independent thought and action. Conversely, a society that valorises innovation and dissent might cultivate a different kind of character, one that is more questioning and adventurous. The legal framework acts as a boundary condition for these social dynamics, defining the outermost limits of acceptable behaviour. If the legal system is perceived as unjust or arbitrary, it can erode the effectiveness of social norms and lead to a breakdown in social order, revealing the fragile nature of the constructed reality that governs our lives. Furthermore, the interplay between individual desires and institutional demands can lead to what might be termed a ""systemic character."" Individuals who consistently operate within a particular institutional framework, such as that of the military or a large bureaucratic organisation, tend to develop common traits. The military institution, for example, actively cultivates obedience, discipline, and a willingness to sacrifice individual desires for the collective goal, thereby shaping the character of its members in a manner consistent with its operational needs. This is not to suggest that these traits are solely a product of external imposition; the underlying instincts for affiliation and hierarchy likely provide fertile ground for such institutional moulding.",1,1,0.99999475,AI,AI
"The experience of collective self-management within the syndicate can cultivate a sense of agency and self-worth that is often stifled in the wage-labour relationship, fostering a more robust and engaged citizenry, less prone to the manipulations of distant political or economic authorities. The removal of the employer-employee dichotomy within the syndicate structure aims to dissolve the psychological subservience that often characterizes the labourer in a capitalist setting, replacing it with a sense of co-ownership and shared purpose. The interaction between these different levels of organization is crucial for understanding the dynamics of social change. At the individual level, the lived experience of class oppression, economic insecurity, or the empowering experience of collective action within a syndicate directly influences one's perceptions, motivations, and actions. These individual experiences, aggregated and shared, contribute to the formation of social movements and the collective consciousness that drives historical change. Social structures, such as class stratification and ideological conditioning, act as powerful constraints or facilitators of individual behaviour. For instance, an individual born into a working-class family in a highly stratified society faces different opportunities and pressures than an individual born into a wealthy family. Their educational choices, career aspirations, and even their understanding of what constitutes a ""good life"" are profoundly shaped by these social realities. Institutions, from the legal system to educational establishments, are the formal embodiment of these social and class structures. They provide the rules of the game, the boundaries within which individuals and groups operate, and the mechanisms for enforcing norms and distributing resources. Legal frameworks that protect private property, for example, reinforce the capitalist class structure by granting disproportionate power to those who own capital.",1,1,0.9999938,AI,AI
"When a purported truth is challenged by an opposing opinion, even a demonstrably false one, it forces proponents of the truth to re-examine their evidence, refine their arguments, and articulate their position more clearly and persuasively. Without this challenge, a truth might remain unchallenged, unexamined, and potentially incomplete or even flawed in its presentation. The suppression of dissenting opinions, even those that appear misguided, risks the suppression of valuable insights or the preservation of unchallenged falsehoods that could masquerade as truth. Conversely, the robust discussion of an opinion that is ultimately revealed to be true, but initially unpopular or unconventional, allows it to gain traction and eventually become accepted. Another crucial relationship is between the exposure to differing opinions and the broadening of individual understanding. The mechanism at play is cognitive exposure and the subsequent recalibration of one's own beliefs. When individuals are exposed to opinions that differ from their own, they are presented with alternative frameworks for understanding the world. This exposure, especially when accompanied by reasoned explanations for those differing opinions, can lead to a more nuanced and comprehensive grasp of complex issues. Even if an individual ultimately retains their original opinion, the process of engaging with opposing viewpoints can illuminate the limitations of their own perspective and foster intellectual humility. The absence of such exposure can lead to intellectual isolation, confirmation bias, and a hardening of beliefs, making individuals less receptive to new information or alternative interpretations of reality. The historical context of this topic reveals a long-standing tension between established doctrines and emerging ideas. Historically, societies have often sought to control public discourse to maintain social order or uphold dominant ideologies. This control has frequently manifested in the suppression of opinions that challenged the prevailing ""truths.""",1,1,0.9999857,AI,AI
"It implies a degree of intellectual honesty, a willingness to engage with opposing viewpoints in good faith, and a commitment to reason and evidence as arbiters. The concept is constrained by the understanding that while all opinions should be heard, not all opinions carry equal weight or are equally deserving of serious consideration. However, the *initial* threshold for hearing an opinion should be very low, because it is difficult to definitively label an opinion as devoid of any potential value or truth-telling capacity without subjecting it to scrutiny. The conceptual framework is also qualified by the understanding that the pursuit of truth is an ongoing, often arduous, process. It is not the case that truth is immediately obvious once a diversity of opinions is presented. Rather, it is the *persistent* and *vigorous* engagement with these opinions that allows for the gradual emergence and solidification of truth. The qualification here is that the absence of immediate consensus does not invalidate the process; indeed, it is often in the prolonged period of disagreement that the most valuable insights are forged. The relationship between these concepts is symbiotic and dynamic. Truth is the ultimate object of the discussion, the end goal that the contestation of opinions aims to reveal or confirm. Opinions, in their plurality and diversity, are the raw material out of which truth is distilled. The discussion is the crucible in which this distillation takes place. Without the free discussion of opinions, truth risks becoming ossified, dogma, or simply an unexamined assumption. Conversely, if opinions are silenced or suppressed, the opportunity to test and refine our understanding of truth is lost. The concept suggests that even false opinions contribute to the advancement of truth in several ways.",1,1,0.9999747,AI,AI
"Opinion, conversely, refers to a belief, judgment, or viewpoint formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge. Opinions can be personal, subjective, and influenced by emotions, values, or biases. They are inherently individualistic and can vary widely without necessarily contradicting a verifiable truth. The crucial interplay arises when these two categories, truth and opinion, enter the public sphere for discussion. The primary mechanism driving the interaction between truth and opinion in public discussion is the process of argumentation and deliberation. This process involves the presentation of claims, supported by evidence and reasoning, which are then subjected to scrutiny, challenge, and debate. When discussing truth claims, the mechanism focuses on the validation or falsification of those claims through empirical data, logical consistency, and peer review. The strength of a truth claim is evaluated based on the robustness of its supporting evidence and the rigor of its logical structure. Conversely, when discussing opinions, the mechanism involves the exploration of the basis for those opinions, the examination of underlying values and perspectives, and the assessment of their potential impact or justification. While opinions may not be subject to the same standards of empirical verification as truth claims, the *discussion* of opinions can still be valuable for understanding the diversity of human thought, identifying areas of consensus and dissent, and fostering empathy. A key relationship exists between the freedom of expression and the advancement of truth. This relationship operates through a causal chain where the unrestricted expression of diverse ideas, including those that may be false or contentious, ultimately serves to strengthen the position of truth. The underlying mechanism here is intellectual friction.",1,1,0.99995494,AI,AI
"The intermediate mechanism here is the reactivation of mnemonic traces, which then colour our immediate perceptual and cognitive processes. This interplay between past and present has significant long-term consequences. Our beliefs, our prejudices, our skills, and our emotional dispositions are all, in large measure, the cumulative product of our past experiences. The social environment plays a crucial role in shaping these formative past experiences. Consider the institutional cause of education. A child's exposure to a particular curriculum, the pedagogical methods employed, and the social interactions within the educational setting all contribute to the formation of their memories and associations. A history lesson, for instance, aims to instill a particular understanding of past events. The causal pathway here is direct: the presentation of information (a form of sensation and cognitive input) leads to the formation of memories and the development of beliefs about the past. The long-term consequence is the individual's conceptualisation of history, which in turn influences their political views, their sense of national identity, and their understanding of societal progress. Furthermore, psychological causes, such as the innate human tendency towards generalization and inference, are intrinsically linked to the functioning of memory. When we encounter a new situation that bears resemblance to a past experience, we tend to infer that similar outcomes will ensue. This inferential process, though often efficient, can also lead to errors of judgment if the resemblances are superficial. The psychological cause here is the cognitive heuristic of drawing parallels, and its effect is the application of past learning to novel circumstances. The intermediate mechanism is the activation of a relevant mnemonic schema, which then guides our expectations and actions. The long-term consequence is the development of habitual patterns of thought and behaviour, which can be either adaptive or maladaptive.",1,1,0.9999896,AI,AI
"These categories are not rigidly distinct but are, rather, different organizational arrangements of a more fundamental, potentially neutral, underlying reality. The ""physical"" occasions the ""mental,"" and the ""mental,"" through action, influences the ""physical."" The ""object"" is the focal point of this interaction, understood through the lens of both its external, physical existence and its internal, mental apprehension. This nuanced understanding allows for a more sophisticated account of consciousness and its place in the wider universe, moving beyond simplistic dualistic frameworks towards a more unified and coherent ontology. END It is a matter of considerable import, indeed of fundamental consequence, to elucidate the intricate tapestry of causation that underpins our apprehension of the world, particularly concerning the interrelation of the object, matter, the mental, and the physical. In the philosophical endeavour, clarity on these foundational concepts is not merely an academic exercise but a prerequisite for any meaningful inquiry into the nature of consciousness and our engagement with the universe. Bertrand Russell, in his seminal work, *The Analysis of Mind*, embarks upon such an elucidation, and it is within this framework that we must situate our understanding. The very distinction we draw between the ‘mental’ and the ‘physical’ is, for Russell, not an ontological chasm separating two fundamentally different kinds of substance, as Cartesian dualism would suggest. Rather, it is a matter of perspective, of how events are organized and apprehended. The ‘physical’ world, in its most rudimentary form, is constituted by what he terms ‘sensa’ – the raw, uninterpreted data of sensation. These are the immediate, qualitative experiences we have: the redness of a rose, the sound of a bell, the feeling of warmth.",1,1,0.99997675,AI,AI
"This process of socialization constitutes a potent causal chain: societal expectations mold individual character, which in turn reinforces the societal expectations. By denying women access to comprehensive education, to professions beyond the most circumscribed limits, and to public discourse, society effectively ensures that their intellectual and practical capacities remain underdeveloped. The consequence is a self-fulfilling prophecy: women, having been denied the means to prove themselves, are then cited as proof of their own inherent incapacities. Mill observes that ""we cannot know what might be, unless we give freedom to all individuals to develop according to their own lights. ""

The dynamic between men and women within this framework is thus one of profound, yet often unacknowledged, mutual distortion. Men, as the beneficiaries of this system of power, acquire a status and authority often unearned, fostering a sense of entitlement and an inability to perceive women as true equals. This unchecked power, Mill suggests, can be deleterious even to the moral character of men themselves, as it removes the necessary friction and challenge that interaction with an equal mind provides. The husband, being elevated to a position of domestic despot, is deprived of the profound intellectual companionship that could arise from a relationship with a fully autonomous and developed individual. His intellect, and indeed his moral compass, is dulled by the absence of genuine reciprocity. Conversely, women, constrained by their roles and denied avenues for independent thought and action, are often forced into strategies of manipulation or passive resistance to achieve their ends, which further reinforces the stereotypes of feminine artifice or weakness. The societal cost is thus immeasurable, for it not only stunts the development of half the human race but also compromises the quality of life and relationships for the other half.",1,1,0.9999944,AI,AI
"The human being, therefore, is a creature whose innate potential for growth and improvement can only be realised under conditions of ample liberty, for liberty provides the indispensable space for self-development, for the testing of convictions, and for the formation of a rich and varied character. Finally, we turn our attention to the concept of **conduct**, which, in the context of *On Liberty*, refers to the observable actions, behaviours, and choices that individuals make in the course of their lives. It is the sphere in which liberty manifests itself and where societal interference is either justified or condemned. As previously alluded to, the crucial distinction lies between self-regarding conduct and other-regarding conduct. Self-regarding conduct comprises those actions that primarily affect only the individual performing them, or if they affect others, do so only with the free, uncoerced, and informed consent of those others, and without any breach of distinct and assignable obligations. Examples of such conduct might include one's choice of diet, leisure pursuits, religious beliefs, or intimate relationships. In this sphere, Mill argues with unwavering conviction, the individual's ""independence is, of right, absolute."" Society has no legitimate claim to intervene, either through legal penalties or through the moral disapprobation of public opinion. Other-regarding conduct, conversely, encompasses those actions that affect the interests of others, particularly when they cause direct harm or violate specific duties. Such conduct falls within the legitimate purview of societal regulation. Here, the ""harm principle"" serves as the sole warrant for intervention. If an individual's action causes physical injury, financial damage, or a breach of a contractual obligation to another, then society is justified in stepping in to prevent or punish such behaviour.",1,1,0.9999815,AI,AI
"Opinion is the provisional, often partial, articulation of belief, susceptible to the imperfections of human understanding. Truth, by contrast, is the ideal to which opinion aspires, a more complete and accurate apprehension of reality. However, truth is not a static object merely awaiting passive discovery; rather, it is something actively pursued, interrogated, and progressively elucidated *through* the dynamic medium of opinion and discussion. The very act of formulating and defending an opinion, of exposing it to the critical gaze of others, of modifying it in light of superior reasoning or evidence, is the mechanism by which individual minds approach nearer to truth, and by which society as a whole accumulates a more profound and reliable body of knowledge. Without this incessant intellectual fermentation, without the constant agitation of minds by opposing viewpoints, truth, even if by some serendipitous chance it were to emerge, would remain a fragile, unexamined thing, prone to distortion and eventual neglect. The vitality of a society, therefore, can be measured not by the uniformity of its opinions, but by the robustness of its discussions, the depth of its intellectual curiosity, and its unwavering commitment to the proposition that no truth is so self-evident that it ought not to be challenged, and no opinion so erroneous that it ought to be silenced. The ceaseless dialectic between truth and opinion, mediated by the indispensable liberty of discussion, is thus the very engine of human progress, demanding of each generation a renewed dedication to the principles of open inquiry and rational discourse. END

The delicate tapestry of human thought, woven from the threads of individual apprehension and collective wisdom, frequently presents its observers with a challenge: to discern, amidst the ceaseless hum of expressed sentiments, the conceptual bedrock upon which our intellectual edifice is raised.",1,1,0.99998283,AI,AI
"However, since the organism itself is composed of physical structures (neurons, atoms), this mnemic causation must ultimately be grounded in physical traces. The mental and the physical are two ways of mapping the same territory: one mapping the territory through the lens of history and individual perspective, the other mapping it through the lens of universal laws and structural invariants. Furthermore, this analysis removes the mystery of how ""mind"" can affect ""matter"" (telekinesis or basic volition) and how ""matter"" can affect ""mind"" (perception). These are not two different things interacting; they are the same events being re-sorted. When I decide to move my arm, the ""will"" is a mental event (a collection of images and desires) that is also a physical event (a neural discharge). The movement of the arm is the continuation of a single causal chain. We call it ""mental"" when we describe the desire; we call it ""physical"" when we describe the muscle contraction. There is no point where the ""ghost"" pushes the ""machine"" because the ghost and the machine are different ways of describing the same sequence of events. The concept of the ""object"" also undergoes a profound transformation in this systematic framework. In common sense, the object is the ""cause"" of our sensation. In this refined analysis, the object is the ""collection"" of sensations. We must distinguish between the ""perceived object"" and the ""physical object."" The perceived object is a datum—a red, round, sweet sensation when biting an apple. The physical object is a complex inference—a collection of atoms, a history of growth, a potential for nutrition. The physical object is an ""extrapolation"" from the perceived data. We construct the idea of the ""apple"" to explain why different people see similar things and why the apple behaves predictably over time.",1,1,0.99989724,AI,AI
"This external limitation on behavior then had internal consequences, shaping character. For instance, the constant channeling into domestic roles, coupled with the absence of opportunities for public achievement, could limit the development of ambition, self-reliance, or intellectual assertiveness. An individual raised within a system that consistently devalues their gender's public contributions might internalize a sense of lesser capability or destiny, leading to a suppression of their own intellectual curiosity or leadership potential. The expectation of emotional fragility in women could hinder the development of resilience or critical thinking, while the expectation of stoicism in men could suppress emotional expression and empathy. Furthermore, the absence of individual representation within institutions—whether in government, business, or academia—perpetuates the status quo. If decision-making bodies are homogeneous in their gender composition, they are less likely to perceive or address the constraints faced by other genders, thus maintaining the existing structures and their impact. These interactions create a feedback loop: institutional limitations constrain behavior, which fosters certain social norms, which in turn inform and legitimate further institutional structures, ultimately shaping the character and self-perception of individuals within the system. An individual woman might internalize the societal message that her primary value lies in her domestic role, leading her to prioritize household duties over a career, even when legal barriers to employment are removed. This individual choice then reinforces the social norm of women's domesticity, which can, in turn, subtly influence institutional policies or workplace cultures that may not fully accommodate women's professional aspirations. Similarly, men, constrained by societal expectations of being primary providers, might feel immense pressure to pursue financially lucrative careers, regardless of personal interest, and to suppress emotional vulnerability, thereby conforming to a prescribed masculine ideal shaped by interwoven social and economic structures.",1,1,0.9999918,AI,AI
"The very fabric of society was thus woven with threads of masculine authority, establishing men as the legitimate proprietors of power, both in the public sphere and within the most intimate confines of domestic life. The key relationship arising from this distribution of power is, invariably, one of dominance and subjection. Society, as an aggregate of customs, laws, and normative expectations, has historically functioned as the primary instrument for enforcing this hierarchy. It has, through its manifold institutions, ensured that the legal personality of women was subsumed within that of their husbands, rendering them devoid of independent rights to property, earnings, or even their own children. The conceptual framework here is one of institutionalized disadvantage, where the very structure of the state and the common law conspired to deprive half of humanity of agency. This legal disenfranchisement was not an arbitrary oversight; it was a deliberate, albeit often unexamined, mechanism to maintain a particular power dynamic, ensuring that men held an almost absolute sway over the lives and destinies of women, especially in marriage, which Mill famously characterizes as the ""only actual bondage known to our law. ""

Beyond the explicit legal mechanisms, society further entrenches this subjection through profound mechanisms of social construction and psychological conditioning. Mill meticulously argues against the prevailing notion that the perceived differences in character and aptitude between men and women are natural or inherent. Instead, he posits that the ""nature"" of women is, to a considerable extent, an artificial product of their circumstances and the restrictive education they receive. Girls, from their earliest years, are systematically trained for domesticity, emotional dependence, and an all-consuming devotion to others, rather than for self-assertion, intellectual pursuits, or public engagement.",1,1,0.99999344,AI,AI
"Mill’s arguments are not predicated solely on an abstract right to free speech, but upon the demonstrable utility of such liberty in promoting the greatest good for the greatest number. The intellectual, moral, and social advancement of humanity, which is the ultimate end of all legislation and social arrangement, is undeniably facilitated by a constant striving for truth, and this striving is most effectively pursued in an environment of robust and unfettered discussion. The cultivation of fully developed human beings, capable of independent thought and rational judgment, itself a higher utility, is contingent upon their engagement with a world of diverse ideas, where conviction is earned through deliberation, not imposed through authority. The causal chain is thus clear and compelling: the suppression of any opinion, however unpopular, impedes the intellectual vitality of the community, hindering the correction of error and the acquisition of new truths. This leads to a public discourse characterized by dead dogma, where beliefs are held as prejudices rather than living convictions, thereby stunting individual intellectual and moral development. Conversely, a society that actively fosters liberty of thought and discussion, embracing the rigorous challenge of diverse opinions, ensures a continuous process of intellectual clarification and refinement. This dynamism not only prevents the stagnation of accepted truths but also facilitates the discovery of new ones, cultivating individuals who are capable of engaging with complex ideas, forming reasoned judgments, and contributing actively to the collective wisdom of mankind. The benefits, therefore, extend beyond mere intellectual enrichment to encompass the moral cultivation of individuals, who, by being compelled to consider and respond to alternative viewpoints, are rendered more tolerant, more discerning, and more profoundly alive to the complex tapestry of human experience. It is imperative to distinguish, and yet simultaneously to understand the intimate connection between, opinion and truth.",1,1,0.99999154,AI,AI
"'Things' are, conceptually, inanimate objects, devoid of consciousness, will, rights, or intrinsic moral value beyond their utility to sentient beings. They are property, commodities, instruments. In a society founded upon principles of individual liberty and the recognition of human dignity, to treat a human being as a 'thing' is the ultimate abrogation of their personhood. Mill meticulously demonstrates how, under English law and prevailing social custom, a married woman was, in significant respects, reduced to a legal non-entity, her property becoming her husband's, her earnings his, her bodily autonomy compromised, her consent often deemed redundant. She possessed no independent legal standing, no voice in public life, and in many respects, no distinct legal identity from her husband. The conceptual boundary between 'persons' and 'things' – a foundational distinction in jurisprudence and ethics – was systematically blurred in the case of women. While Mill acknowledges that a woman was not literally a chattel to be bought and sold in the marketplace, her legal incapacitation and economic dependency rendered her status perilously close to that of a possession, subject to the arbitrary will of another. This conceptual slippage, where a sentient, rational, moral agent is legally classified and treated akin to an object, serves as a powerful indictment of the prevailing system, revealing its fundamental irrationality and profound injustice. The implicit assumption is that the very definition of humanity and morality rests upon a clear and unwavering distinction between human subjects with inherent rights and inanimate objects without such rights. Finally, the concept of 'great' in *The Subjection of Women* extends far beyond mere individual achievement; it encompasses the aspirations for societal flourishing, moral progress, intellectual advancement, and the optimal realization of human potential in its broadest sense.",1,1,0.99998343,AI,AI
"The class divisions create the fertile ground for such conflict, shaping the individual worker's perception of their place in society and their potential for agency. Similarly, syndicalist ideals are inherently tied to the organization of labor, proposing a specific institutional and legal restructuring based on this organized force. The legal system, in turn, can either facilitate or hinder the development and effectiveness of labor organizations and the pursuit of syndicalist goals. Socially, the narrative of class struggle, propagated by Marxist thought, can fuel the solidarity within labor movements, while the vision of worker self-governance, central to syndicalism, can inspire a particular form of collective character among laborers. The institutional level is where these forces manifest most concretely. Factories, corporations, government bodies, and educational establishments are all institutions shaped by class relations, influenced by Marxist critiques, and potentially reorganized along syndicalist lines or through the bargaining power of labor unions. Legal institutions, such as courts, legislatures, and regulatory agencies, are the arenas where the conflicts and aspirations arising from class, Marxism, and labor are adjudicated, codified, or resisted. Social institutions, including families, communities, media outlets, and cultural organizations, act as conduits for transmitting ideologies, reinforcing social norms, and shaping individual attitudes towards class, work, and authority. Individual behavior and character are not simply products of innate predispositions but are deeply molded by these systemic forces. The constant negotiation of power within the labor market, dictated by class structures, shapes the individual's sense of self-worth and their perception of opportunity. The narratives of exploitation and revolution offered by Marxist thought can inspire a sense of righteous indignation or a belief in the inevitability of change, influencing an individual's political engagement and their willingness to challenge authority.",1,1,0.9999926,AI,AI
"It is a testament to the persuasive force of long-established habit that even intelligent men struggle to envision a society where the relationships between the sexes are not dictated by the unequal distribution of power, but rather by the principles of justice, liberty, and rational co-operation. The character formed by the current system thus finds itself ill-equipped to imagine, let alone embrace, the radical reform that the principles of equity demand. In sum, the examination of ""human power"" as embodied by men, within the historical and social context illuminated by * The Subjection of Women*, reveals it to be a structure not of inherent natural right but of established advantage, solidified by law and custom. This structure exerts a profound and often deleterious influence upon the character of men, fostering dispositions of command, intellectual complacency, self-interest, and a certain moral blindness to the injustices inherent in their position. These character traits, in turn, serve to perpetuate the very system from which they derive, creating a circular causality that entrenches inequality. The ultimate consequence is not merely the denial of justice and opportunity to women, but a profound diminution of human welfare overall. Society is deprived of the full complement of intellectual and moral resources that liberated women could offer, whilst men themselves are frequently stunted in their ethical and intellectual development, denied the enriching experience of true companionship and the profound lessons in justice and empathy that only an equal relationship can provide. The imperative for reform, therefore, arises not merely from a consideration of female emancipation, but from a comprehensive understanding of how the current distribution of power distorts and diminishes the character of men, thereby impeding the collective progress of humanity towards a more rational and just social order.",1,1,0.9999889,AI,AI
"The ""social"" is the result of the intersection of many individual biographies. When these biographies overlap significantly—sharing the same language, the same perceptions of physical objects, and the same mnemic responses to legal stimuli—an institution is born. The institution then takes on a causal life of its own, acting as a physical force that can compel bodies to move, gather, or labor in specific ways. The direction of influence often appears to be from the physical to the mental, especially in the realm of modern technology and infrastructure. The physical layout of a city, for instance, dictates the flow of human movement, which in turn shapes the daily sensations and habits of its inhabitants. These habits eventually solidify into the ""mental"" character of the population. However, the reverse is equally true. The mental images of architects and planners, driven by desires for efficiency or beauty, are the causal precursors to the physical construction of the city. The intermediate mechanism is the labor and engineering that translate a private image into a public object. The long-term consequence of this interaction is a world that is increasingly a ""humanized"" environment, where the distinction between ""natural"" physical causality and ""artificial"" mental causality becomes blurred. One of the most profound effects of this causal structure is the dissolution of the concept of the ""subject"" or the ""ego"" as a permanent entity. If the mind is simply a biography of events, then personal identity is a social and psychological construction rather than an ontological fact. This has significant legal and ethical consequences. It suggests that the ""self"" is a process that can be influenced and redirected. Institutional interventions, such as rehabilitation or propaganda, are based on this premise.",1,1,0.9999913,AI,AI
"The implicit assumption here is that collective ownership is a superior model for achieving social justice, economic stability, and equitable distribution of resources compared to capitalist systems. Socialism, in this specific instantiation, is constrained by its commitment to state control; it is not a decentralized, anarchist form of collective ownership, but one that emphasizes centralized governance and planning. The conceptual distinction is crucial: socialism can manifest in various forms, but ""work_present_socialism_state"" specifically refers to a state-centric model. The ""state"" is the primary agent of this socialist organization. It is conceived as the entity that owns and controls the means of production, dictates what is produced, and organizes the labor force to achieve these ends. This is a significant conceptualization, as it grants the state considerable power and responsibility. The implicit assumption is that the state, when properly constituted and guided by socialist principles, can act as a benevolent and efficient manager of the economy, capable of prioritizing societal needs over individual profit motives. This conception of the state is constrained by its role as the ultimate arbiter of economic destinies. It is not a minimal state concerned only with defense and law, but an interventionist entity deeply embedded in the fabric of economic life. The conceptual distinction is between a laissez-faire state and a socialist state that actively manages production and distribution. The term ""present"" is not temporal in the sense of describing a current, existing reality, but rather conceptual, referring to the *presenting* or *proposed* form of socialism as Russell analyzes it. It denotes a specific model of socialism that is being articulated and examined, as opposed to other potential or historical iterations. This ""present"" form is characterized by its direct engagement with the mechanisms of modern industrial society.",1,1,0.9999907,AI,AI
"Conversely, liberty is not solely defined by the absence of restraint; it also encompasses the capacity and opportunity to pursue one’s chosen ends. This proactive dimension of liberty involves access to resources, information, and the power to effect change. The historical trajectory of societies is marked by ongoing struggles to define and expand the scope of individual liberty against the backdrop of established societal power structures. Enlightenment ideals, emphasizing reason and individual autonomy, significantly contributed to conceptualizing liberty as a primary human right, leading to revolutions and reforms aimed at curtailing arbitrary authority and expanding spheres of individual freedom. Human conduct, the third integral component, encompasses the actions, behaviors, and choices of individuals within the societal context. This conduct is shaped by a complex interplay of internal motivations – desires, beliefs, values – and external influences, including societal norms, legal regulations, and the actions of other individuals. The mechanisms that drive human conduct are multifaceted, involving biological predispositions, psychological processes, and socio-cultural conditioning. Individuals are driven by self-interest, the pursuit of happiness, and the desire for social acceptance. Simultaneously, empathy, moral reasoning, and a sense of duty can also motivate conduct. The propensity for both cooperation and conflict, for altruism and self-preservation, resides within human nature and is significantly modulated by the societal environment in which individuals are situated. The relationship between these three components is dynamic and dialectical. Society, as a framework for collective existence, necessitates a degree of conformity in human conduct. However, the legitimacy and vitality of any society are deeply intertwined with the liberty it affords its members. Excessive curtailment of liberty can lead to social unrest, alienation, and a stifling of innovation, ultimately undermining the societal fabric. Conversely, unrestrained individual liberty, devoid of any societal constraints, would devolve into chaos, rendering collective life impossible.",1,1,0.9999906,AI,AI
"In surveying the landscape of proposed societal transformations, particularly those that seek to mitigate the ills of the present capitalist order, one encounters a constellation of concepts that require rigorous examination. Among these, the notions of class, Marx, syndicalism, and labor, as they are implicitly or explicitly engaged within Bertrand Russell’s *Proposed Roads to Freedom*, form a critical nexus for understanding his vision of a desirable future. It is essential to elucidate these terms with precision, to grasp their definitions, their limitations, and their intricate interrelationships as conceived within this seminal work. The concept of **class** is, for Russell, primarily an economic and social stratification rooted in the ownership, or lack thereof, of the means of production. While Marx’s analysis, which deeply informs Russell’s critique, posits a fundamental antagonism between the bourgeoisie (owners of capital) and the proletariat (wage laborers), Russell’s perspective, while acknowledging this dichotomy, tends towards a more nuanced, albeit still critical, understanding of its manifestations. Implicitly, Russell assumes that societal structures are profoundly shaped by economic power dynamics, and that the existence of distinct classes, defined by their relationship to wealth and control, leads to inherent inequalities and social friction. The conceptual distinction here lies in Russell’s emphasis not merely on the existence of classes, but on their detrimental *effects* on individual liberty and character. He is less concerned with a dialectical progression driven by class struggle, and more with the practical consequences of class divisions for human well-being and the cultivation of a more humane disposition. In *Proposed Roads to Freedom*, the constraint on the concept of class is its eventual dissolution or significant amelioration in the envisioned future. Russell does not propose a system that perpetuates class distinctions, but one that aims to render them obsolete by fundamentally altering the economic basis of society.",1,1,0.9999887,AI,AI
"The existing social order is one wherein the accident of birth, specifically one's sex, dictates one’s entire destiny, opportunities, and legal standing. This conceptualisation of society reveals its fundamental flaw: it is not yet organised according to the principles of justice, utility, and individual liberty that purportedly animate modern civilisation. Mill views society as a powerful, though often unconscious, agent that perpetuates inequalities through its customs, institutions, and the pervasive force of public opinion. He frequently draws a distinction between the external, legally codified aspects of society and its more insidious internal mechanisms – the inculcation of certain ideas, the shaping of desires, and the creation of restrictive expectations that prevent women from even conceiving of lives beyond their prescribed spheres. The ""society"" Mill critiques is one that, despite its claims to progress, clings to an archaic injustice, thereby hindering its own advancement. He implicitly assumes that society has a moral obligation to maximise the well-being and development of all its members, and that its failure to do so, particularly in the case of women, constitutes a profound waste of human resources and a stain upon its ethical integrity. An ideal society, by contrast, would be one founded upon the principle of ""perfect equality,"" where merit alone determines one's sphere, and all individuals, irrespective of sex, are free to develop their faculties to the fullest extent. Central to the entire edifice of Mill’s argument is the concept of ""power,"" its nature, its sources, and its profound influence on the conceptualisation of men and women within society. Power, in this context, refers not merely to physical force, though its historical origins are rooted in such, but more pervasively to legal, economic, social, and psychological control.",1,1,0.99998796,AI,AI
"The ""desire for food"" is not necessarily a thought in their head; it is the objective fact that only food will terminate their current state of agitation. Desire is thus a description of a behavioral trajectory rather than a private mental state. Implicit in this view of desire is a distinction between the ""object"" of desire and the ""objective"" of desire. The object is what a person might *think* they want if they were to introspect; the objective is the actual state of affairs that will produce quiescence. Often, these two do not coincide. A person may think they desire fame (the object), but upon achieving it, they find their restlessness remains. The true objective was perhaps social belonging or security. By defining desire through the cessation of a behavioral cycle, we gain a more precise tool for analyzing the gap between our conscious self-reports and our actual biological and psychological needs. The relationship between these concepts is further complicated and enriched by ""mnemic causation."" This is a pivotal term for understanding how past experience influences present action without requiring a conscious memory. In the physical world, causes are typically seen as immediate and local. In the mental world, however, an organism’s response to a stimulus is determined not just by the stimulus itself, but by the organism’s past history. This ""mnemic"" quality is what distinguishes a living being from a simple machine. When an animal avoids a trap it has previously encountered, its behavior is governed by a causal chain that includes its past experience. This experience is ""stored"" not necessarily as a photograph-like memory, but as a modification of the organism’s instinctive and desire-driven behavior-cycles.",1,1,0.999982,AI,AI
"The pursuit of a just and flourishing society necessitates a precise understanding of fundamental concepts that define individual existence and social organization. Within a philosophical framework focused on individual liberty, social utility, and the advancement of human potential, certain terms—human, power, men, and character—acquire specific, nuanced meanings. These concepts are not merely descriptive labels but analytical tools, revealing the underlying assumptions about human nature, societal structures, and the pathways to progress. Their definitions are often constrained by prevailing customs and prejudices, yet their ideal articulations point towards a more equitable and rational order. Grasping their interrelations is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of social justice and individual fulfillment. At the core of this inquiry lies the concept of the **human**. From a liberal perspective, a human is fundamentally a rational and sentient being, endowed with an inherent capacity for self-development, moral agency, and the pursuit of their own unique good. This capacity is universal, belonging to all individuals irrespective of their accidental attributes such as sex, race, or social origin. The essence of being human involves the faculty of reason, which allows for deliberation, judgment, and the formation of considered preferences. It also encompasses the capacity for sympathy, altruism, and the recognition of others' similar claims to well-being. Crucially, the concept of the human is forward-looking; it speaks to potential as much as present reality. A truly human existence is one where this potential for intellectual growth, moral refinement, and the full exercise of one's faculties is not merely acknowledged but actively fostered. Societal arrangements that restrict this development, particularly through arbitrary distinctions, diminish not only the individual but also the collective richness and progress of humanity itself.",1,1,0.9999907,AI,AI
"Socialism, as envisioned in various forms, proposes a fundamental restructuring of these elements. At its core, it seeks to alter the relationship between the worker, the product of their labor, and the broader community. The proposed ""roads"" suggest a move away from private ownership of the means of production towards some form of collective or communal control. This shift, if actualized, would necessitate a profound transformation of institutional structures. Instead of the capitalist enterprise, we might see worker cooperatives, industrial guilds, or state-managed industries as the primary organizational units of production. The legal framework would, consequently, need to adapt, shifting from the protection of private capital to the regulation and facilitation of these collective ownership models. This might involve new forms of contract, dispute resolution, and profit distribution. Socially, the aim is to dismantle the rigid class distinctions that characterize capitalism. The removal of economic fear, the dread of poverty, and the desperate hope of accumulating vast fortunes, which currently drive so much human behavior, are central to this aspiration. If economic security is guaranteed, and the rewards of labor are distributed more equitably, then the motivations for individual action would, by necessity, undergo a significant alteration. The concept of ""work"" itself would likely be re-envisioned. In a socialist system, the emphasis could shift from work as a means to accumulate private wealth to work as a contribution to the common good, a form of social service. The institutional structure of the workplace would likely evolve. Guild socialism, for instance, posits autonomous industrial guilds responsible for the production and distribution of goods and services within their respective sectors. These guilds, it is argued, would democratize the workplace, allowing workers a greater say in the organization of their labor.",1,1,0.9999782,AI,AI
"This circular reasoning acts as an intermediate mechanism, cementing the prejudice in the male mind and making any challenge to the status quo appear not merely inconvenient, but unnatural, perhaps even dangerous. The intermediate mechanisms by which these causes translate into character traits are multifaceted. Habituation plays a crucial role: the repeated exercise of authority, the constant experience of deference, and the unceasing affirmation of one's own superior position inevitably shape patterns of thought and behaviour. These habits then crystallise into dispositions, becoming ""second nature,"" so that what was initially a learned response becomes an almost instinctive reaction. Furthermore, the lack of counter-pressure from women, who are systematically disempowered and denied the means of effective protest, means that the male character is rarely challenged to reconsider its assumptions or temper its assertions. There is no external force that compels men, on pain of social or legal sanction, to develop greater empathy, self-restraint, or justice in their dealings with women. The internalisation of societal norms, where male dominance is presented as natural, traditional, or even divinely ordained, ensures that these precepts become deeply embedded in the individual psyche, rendering them exceedingly difficult to dislodge. The long-term consequences of this systematic cultivation of the ""human_power_men_character"" are deleterious not only for women, but for men themselves, and for the advancement of human civilisation in its entirety. For men, the continuous exercise of unjust power, particularly within the intimate sphere of the family, can lead to a lamentable moral degeneration. It breeds a species of self-indulgence and caprice, where the habits of command supplant the virtues of persuasion, patience, and mutual respect. Such a character is less amenable to reason, less capable of genuine fellow-feeling, and less inclined towards the cultivation of universal justice.",1,1,0.99999475,AI,AI
