To understand the nature of the mind through the lenses of sensation, image, and memory, one must first dismantle the traditional dualism that separates physical matter from mental experience. The investigation begins with the premise that both the mental and physical worlds are constructed from a single, neutral underlying substance. This perspective suggests that the difference between a "thought" and a "thing" is not a difference in essence, but a difference in arrangement and causal laws. At the center of this construction are sensations. A sensation is the immediate intersection between the environment and the nervous system; it is the point where a physical stimulus—such as light waves striking the retina—becomes a constituent of experience. Sensations are the primary building blocks of all mental life. They are not purely "mental" in the sense of being internal ghosts, nor are they purely "physical" in the sense of being inert matter; they are the raw data from which both physics and psychology are derived.

Sensations are characterized by their immediate presence and their direct causal link to external stimuli. However, the mind does not remain a passive receiver of immediate sensory data. If it did, consciousness would be confined to a perpetual "now," a flickering sequence of disconnected impacts. The bridge between the immediate sensation and the complexity of thought is the "image." An image is a mental constituent that bears a resemblance to a sensation but exists in the absence of the original stimulus. When one "sees" a sunset in their mind's eye or "hears" a melody in silence, they are experiencing images. These are often described as "faint" or "copy-like" versions of sensations. Yet, the distinction is more than just intensity. The image follows different causal laws. While a sensation of heat requires the presence of a fire or a sun, the image of heat can be summoned by association, by the will, or by the lingering traces of past experience.

The relationship between sensations and images is the foundation of cognitive continuity. Images are the "stuff" of memory and desire, providing the material for everything that is not immediately present to the senses. The transition from sensation to image involves a process of retention. When a sensation occurs, it leaves behind a modification in the organism—a physiological and psychological "trace." This trace enables the later occurrence of an image that corresponds to the initial sensation. This leads to the concept of mnemic causation, a crucial mechanism in the analysis of the mind. In the physical sciences, causality is typically seen as contiguous; one billiard ball hits another, and the effect is immediate. In psychology, however, a past event can act as a direct cause of a present mental state without a continuous chain of intermediate physical steps being consciously observed. The past sensation "causes" the present image because the organism has been altered by its history. This mnemic causality is what allows the mind to transcend the immediate present.

Memory, therefore, is not a simple storage chest of past events but a complex psychological phenomenon involving images and specific feelings. To remember is not merely to have an image; one can have an image of a centaur without remembering one. Memory requires that an image be accompanied by a "feeling of familiarity" and a "feeling of pastness." Familiarity is a primitive, non-conceptual recognition—a sense that "this has happened before." It is the difference between seeing a stranger and seeing an old friend. When an image arises with this quality of familiarity, it is further refined by a belief-feeling that locates the image in the past. This temporal localization is what transforms a mere mental picture into a memory. The "feeling of pastness" acts as a temporal tag, indicating that the original sensation from which this image is derived exists at a certain distance from the current moment.

The concept of "pastness" is inextricably linked to the structure of time as experienced by the mind. The mind operates within a "specious present"—a short duration where the immediate past and the immediate future overlap with the now. Within this window, the transition from sensation to image is almost seamless. As one moves further away from the sensation, the image must do the heavy lifting of representation. The "past" is not a place that is visited but a construction built from these image-representations and the causal sequences that link them. For a memory to be considered "true," there must be a correspondence between the current memory-image and the past sensation. However, since the past sensation is gone, the mind relies on the consistency of its internal maps and the causal regularity of mnemic traces to validate its history.

The sensations that form the basis of our experience are also the basis of our "perspective." Every sensation is tied to a specific point in space and time—the location of the sensing organism. This subjectivity does not imply that the sensation is "unreal" or "purely private," but rather that it is a member of a specific collection of data. In this framework, a "piece of matter" can be defined as the collection of all sensations and potential sensations (appearances) from all possible perspectives. Conversely, a "mind" is the collection of sensations and images associated with a single perspective over time. This removes the need for a "subject" or an "ego" that sits behind the eyes. The mind is simply the bundle of these perceptions, images, and the causal links between them.

The interaction between sensations and images also accounts for the phenomenon of "meaning." A sensation or an image "means" something when it points toward something else. In the case of memory, the image "means" the past sensation. In the case of language, a word (a sensation of sound or an image of text) "means" an object or a concept because it has become causally linked to that object through habit and association. This associative mechanism is essentially a form of mnemic causality. The repeated pairing of a sensation (the word "apple") with another sensation (the sight/taste of an apple) creates a habit in the organism. Eventually, the image of the word is sufficient to evoke the image of the fruit. Meaning is thus a functional relationship between mental constituents, rather than a mystical property of the soul.

As we delve deeper into the nature of images, we find they are the primary vehicles for belief. A belief is a mental state that points toward a "fact." When we believe a memory, we are holding an image to be a faithful representation of a past sensation. The "feeling of belief" is another distinct psychological accompaniment, similar to the "feeling of familiarity." It is a tension, a direction of the mind toward the image as an assertion of reality. Without images, belief would have no content; without belief, images would be mere phantasms, indistinguishable from the products of pure imagination or hallucination. The distinction between imagination and memory, therefore, lies not in the "stuff" of the images themselves—which may be identical—but in the feelings of belief and pastness that accompany them.

This leads to the question of the "accuracy" of the past. If the past is constructed from images and beliefs, how can we be certain of its reality? The analysis suggests that the past is a theoretical construct used to explain the present state of the organism. We find ourselves with certain images and "traces" that cannot be explained by current sensory input. To make sense of these traces, we postulate a sequence of past events that follow the laws of physics and psychology. The past is "real" in the sense that it is the most coherent explanation for the structure of our present images and sensations. The causal chains of mnemic phenomena—how one thought leads to another, how a smell triggers a childhood memory—provide the skeleton of this temporal architecture.

Sensations and images also play a vital role in the formation of "abstract ideas." Traditional views often struggle to explain how we can have a general idea of a "dog" when we only ever see specific dogs. From the perspective of images and sensations, an abstract idea is not a separate, non-physical entity but a "vague image." When we experience many different sensations of dogs, the resulting images overlap. The features that are common to all dogs become reinforced, while the features specific to individual dogs (like a particular color or size) become blurred or faint. The "general idea" is thus a blurred image that can represent any member of a class because its specific, differentiating details have been neutralized through the repetition of varied sensations.

The mechanism of "desire" and "will" can also be analyzed through the interplay of images and sensations. A desire is essentially an image of a state of affairs (the goal) accompanied by a feeling of discomfort in the present. This discomfort acts as a causal force, driving the organism to act in ways that will bring about the sensation that corresponds to the image of the goal. When the sensation finally matches the image, the discomfort ceases, and the desire is "satisfied." This reduces what seems like a complex spiritual drive to a system of causal interactions between present sensations and future-oriented images. The "will" is the process by which these images of goals become the dominant causes of physical movement.

Memory's role in this process is to provide the "library" of possible goals and the "map" of how to achieve them. Without memory, we would have no images of satisfaction to pursue. We would react to present stimuli with instinctive reflexes, but we would lack the ability to organize our behavior toward long-term ends. Memory allows for the "re-presentation" of past satisfactions, turning them into current images of desire. The sensations of the past are thus recycled into the motives of the future. The continuity of the self is not a continuous "substance" but a continuous "causal stream" where sensations are transformed into images, and images are organized by memory to guide further sensations.

The distinction between "subjective" and "objective" also becomes a matter of causal classification. An event is "objective" if it follows the laws of physics—the laws governing the interactions of sensations across many perspectives. An event is "subjective" if it follows the laws of psychology—specifically the laws of mnemic causation and the interaction of images within a single biography. A sensation of a chair is objective because it can be verified by multiple observers (other perspectives) and follows the laws of optics. The memory-image of that chair is subjective because it exists only in the causal stream of one individual and follows the laws of association and habit. Both are "real," but they belong to different causal systems.

The sensation-image-memory complex also sheds light on the nature of consciousness itself. Consciousness is not a light that shines on objects; it is a characteristic of certain mental complexes. It arises when sensations and images are linked by mnemic causality in a way that allows for "knowledge." Knowledge is not a mysterious contact between a knower and a known; it is a practical relationship. We "know" a sensation when it gives rise to a correct image-representation or a correct behavioral response. Consciousness is the heightened state of this representational activity. When an organism is primarily governed by immediate, non-mnemic sensations (like a simple reflex), we say it is less conscious. When it is governed by a rich web of images, memories, and beliefs, we say it is highly conscious.

Furthermore, the "feeling of familiarity" that accompanies memory images serves as a crucial evolutionary tool. It allows an organism to quickly categorize environmental data as "safe" or "dangerous" based on prior exposure, without needing to perform a full rational analysis. This feeling is a psychological shorthand for a complex history of sensations. When combined with the "feeling of pastness," it allows the organism to orient itself in time. This orientation is essential for any complex action. To act, one must know where they are, which involves knowing where they have been. The "past" is the anchor that prevents the image-stream from drifting into pure fantasy.

The relationship between sensations and images is also mediated by "attention." Attention is the process by which certain sensations are selected for more intense processing, leading to more vivid images and stronger mnemic traces. A sensation that is not attended to may pass through the nervous system without leaving a trace, effectively "forgotten" before it is even "remembered." This selectivity explains why our memory is not a perfect recording of every sensation we have ever had. The mind is an active filter, and the "past" we remember is a curated collection of sensations that were once the focus of our attention.

In summarizing the interaction of these components, we see a picture of the mind as a dynamic system of "neutral" elements. Sensations are the points of entry, the sparks that ignite the mental process. Images are the echoes of these sparks, persisting and interacting according to their own psychological laws. Memory is the organizational force that tags these images with familiarity and pastness, creating a coherent history from the fragments of experience. The "past" is the causal shadow cast by sensations onto the present, allowing for the emergence of meaning, belief, and purpose.

This systematic analysis reveals that the complexity of human thought does not require a specialized "mental" substance. By understanding how sensations leave traces, how these traces manifest as images, and how these images are categorized by feelings of belief and time, we can explain the most sophisticated operations of the mind. The mind is a bridge between the physical impact of the world (sensation) and the internal representation of that world (image). Memory is the process that ensures this bridge is not rebuilt every second, but rather stands as a continuous structure, allowing the individual to navigate the world not just as a physical object, but as a historical being. The sensations of the present are always being woven into the images of the past, creating the integrated fabric of experience that we recognize as the mind. Through this causal chain, the "past" is never truly gone; it is preserved in the very structure of the images that define our present reality. The mind, in essence, is the totality of this preservation, a living record of the sensations that have shaped its current form.

END

The ontological landscape of the human mind can be understood as a complex interplay of sensations, images, and memories, all governed by a distinct form of causality that differs from the purely physical interactions of inert matter. At the foundation of this structure lies the sensation, which serves as the primary interface between the external world and the internal life of the subject. Sensations are the immediate results of physical stimuli acting upon the sensory organs, yet they possess a dual character. While they are physical in their origin, they are mental in their manifestation as the raw data of experience. From these sensations, the mind generates images, which are essentially weakened or secondary versions of sensations that occur in the absence of the original external stimulus. The causal link between a sensation and an image is one of derivation; an image of a sunset can only exist because a sensation of a sunset preceded it. However, images are not merely passive reflections. They are the building blocks of the complex mental phenomena we identify as memory and thought, forming a bridge between the immediate present and the distant past.

The causal structure of the past is not a static repository of events but an active force operating through what can be termed mnemic causality. In the physical world, causality is generally viewed as contiguous; for one billiard ball to move another, they must collide in time and space. In the mental world, however, an event that occurred years ago can directly influence a present action without any obvious physical intermediary other than the persistence of the organism. This mnemic causality suggests that the past is functionally present within the mind through the medium of images and habits. A memory is more than just a re-occurring image; it is an image accompanied by a specific feeling of belief and a sense of "pastness." This feeling of pastness acts as a causal mechanism that allows the individual to distinguish between a current perception, a mere fantasy, and a legitimate recollection of a prior sensation. This distinction is crucial because it provides the temporal continuity necessary for the development of a stable identity and the capacity for planned behavior.

The psychological effects of this causal structure are most clearly seen in the formation of habits and the development of the "person." When a sensation is repeated or accompanied by a strong emotional valence, the resulting images become more readily accessible, creating a path of least resistance within the mental apparatus. This is the psychological mechanism of association. If an individual experiences a specific stimulus followed by a specific outcome, the mental image of the outcome becomes causally linked to the sensation of the stimulus. Over time, this linkage hardens into habit, where the intermediate step of conscious imaging may even be bypassed. The long-term consequence of this process is the creation of a predictable character. From a psychological perspective, what we call the "self" is largely a bundle of such mnemic causal chains. The past exerts a continuous pressure on the present, shaping responses and narrowing the field of potential actions based on the accumulated weight of prior sensations and their corresponding images.

Moving from the individual to the collective, these psychological mechanisms serve as the foundation for social causes and effects. Language, perhaps the most significant social institution, operates entirely through the causal structure of images and memory. A word is a physical sensation—a sound heard or a mark seen—that has been causally linked through social convention to a specific set of images. For a language to function, there must be a shared mnemic landscape among its speakers. The social cause here is the collective agreement to associate specific sounds with specific mental images. The effect is the ability to bridge the gap between individual minds, allowing the mnemic experiences of one person to be transmitted to another. This creates a secondary layer of causality where the past experiences of a community, preserved in language and lore, can influence the behavior of an individual who did not experience the original sensations. This socialized memory serves as a stabilizing force, ensuring that the lessons of the past are not lost with the death of the individual.

Institutional causes emerge when these shared mnemic structures are formalized into systems of governance, education, and law. These institutions are designed to regulate the causal flow of human behavior by intervening in the psychological process of habit formation. Education, for instance, is an institutionalized method for creating specific mnemic associations in the minds of the young. By systematically exposing students to certain sensations and narratives, the institution aims to produce a set of reliable images and beliefs that will govern their future conduct. The direction of influence moves from the institutional authority to the individual’s mental structure, with the intermediate mechanism being the repeated presentation of information. The long-term consequence is the homogenization of thought and behavior within a society, providing the predictability necessary for large-scale cooperation.

The legal system provides one of the most sophisticated examples of the causal application of memory and belief. At the heart of the law lies the concept of responsibility, which is fundamentally a question of the causal continuity of the person. For a person to be held legally liable for a past action, there must be a belief in a persistent "self" that connects the individual in the present to the individual who experienced the sensations of the past event. The legal process acts as an externalized mechanism for verifying memory. In a courtroom, the competing images held by witnesses are weighed against physical traces to reconstruct a narrative of the past. The institutional cause in this context is the legal code, which establishes the rules for how memories are to be evaluated and what consequences should follow from them.

The direction of influence in legal structures is often corrective or deterrent. When the law imposes a punishment, it is attempting to create a powerful and unpleasant mnemic association that will act as a causal deterrent against future similar actions. The intermediate mechanism is the fear of the sensation of punishment, which produces an image of future pain that competes with the desire for the immediate sensation of the crime. The long-term consequence of this institutional causality is the creation of a "legal subject"—an individual who has internalized the causal laws of the state and whose behavior is regulated by the anticipated images of legal consequences. This internal regulation is what allows for the relative peace and order of civil society, as the threat of the law becomes a permanent fixture in the individual’s mental landscape.

Furthermore, the legal and social focus on "truth" and "falsehood" in memory highlights the tension between the subjective nature of images and the objective requirements of institutional stability. Because memory is a psychological construction based on images, it is inherently fallible. Sensations fade, and the images that replace them can be distorted by subsequent experiences or current desires. However, institutions require a version of the past that is treated as absolute. This leads to the creation of formal records—written history, contracts, and registries—which serve as an artificial, indestructible memory. These records act as a social causal mechanism that overrides the fluctuating mnemic images of individuals. When a person’s memory of a contract differs from the written document, the institutional weight of the document prevails. The effect is to decouple social reality from the vagaries of individual psychology, creating a stable platform for commerce and long-term planning.

The economic implications of this structure are equally profound. The concept of credit, for instance, is a purely mnemic phenomenon. It is an institutionalized belief in a future sensation—the repayment of debt—based on the past behavior of an individual. The causal chain here involves the assessment of an individual's "reputation," which is a social image constructed from their history of actions. If the images associated with a person are those of reliability, the institutional effect is the granting of credit, which in turn provides the physical means for new sensations and experiences. The direction of influence flows from the collective memory of the market to the individual’s economic capacity. The long-term consequence of such a system is the accumulation of capital and the development of complex economic interdependencies that transcend local, immediate sensations.

On a broader scale, the causal structure of memory and images drives the evolution of culture and tradition. A tradition is essentially a massive, intergenerational habit. It is a set of behaviors and beliefs that are passed down through the causal mechanism of social imitation and the reinforcement of specific images. The past, in the form of tradition, acts as a powerful institutional cause that shapes the sensations and interpretations of the present generation. When an individual is born into a culture, their mental landscape is not a blank slate but is immediately populated by the images and associations of their forebears. The intermediate mechanism is the process of enculturation, where the social environment provides a constant stream of stimuli designed to produce a specific mnemic profile. The long-term consequence is the persistence of cultural identity, which can remain stable for centuries despite the complete turnover of the individual members of the group.

However, the causal influence of the past is not always stabilizing. In the context of social trauma or systemic injustice, the mnemic causality of a community can become a source of ongoing conflict. If a group shares a collective memory of injury, that image of the past acts as a persistent cause in the present, shaping their interpretation of modern sensations and institutional interactions. This can lead to a cycle of grievance where the past is constantly re-enacted, as the psychological feeling of "pastness" is replaced by a sense of "ever-presentness." The legal and institutional attempts to resolve such conflicts often involve "truth commissions" or historical revisions, which are essentially attempts to re-engineer the collective mnemic structure of the society. By changing the official narrative—the social image of the past—these institutions hope to change the causal effects that the past has on the present behavior of the citizens.

The interaction between physical causality and mnemic causality also has significant implications for our understanding of human agency. If our actions are the effects of a causal chain of sensations, images, and habits, the room for "free will" in the traditional sense appears limited. Yet, the complexity of these causal chains allows for a high degree of unpredictability. Because each individual’s mnemic history is unique, the same sensation can produce vastly different images and actions in different people. This psychological diversity is the source of social innovation. When an individual’s internal causal chain produces a novel image—a creative thought or a new way of solving a problem—and that image is communicated through language, it can become a new social cause, eventually leading to institutional change. The direction of influence here is bottom-up, from the individual’s psychological processes to the social and institutional structures.

The long-term consequences of this entire causal framework point toward a gradual refinement of the human mental apparatus. As we develop more sophisticated institutions for the storage and verification of memory—from oral tradition to writing, and from libraries to digital databases—the "past" becomes increasingly dense and influential. We are, in a sense, becoming more "mnemic" beings, whose present sensations are filtered through an ever-expanding library of images and historical data. This leads to a greater capacity for foresight and complex organization, but it also risks an increasing detachment from immediate physical sensations. The institutional and psychological weight of the past can become so heavy that it stifles the ability of the individual to respond purely to the sensations of the present.

In tracing these effects, we see that the causal structure underlying images, memory, and sensations is the invisible scaffolding of the human world. It begins with the simple derivation of an image from a sensation but quickly escalates into the psychological formation of habits, the social construction of language, and the institutionalization of law and history. The direction of influence is often circular: social institutions shape the psychological habits of individuals, and those individuals, through their mnemic responses, maintain or alter the institutions. The intermediate mechanisms—belief, association, language, and punishment—are the gears that allow this system to function across time. The long-term consequences are nothing less than the entirety of human civilization, which is ultimately a collective project of managing the causal power of the past to stabilize the sensations of the present and secure the images of the future.

This systemic view allows us to see that the distinction between the "internal" world of the mind and the "external" world of society is largely a matter of the type of causality being observed. Mental phenomena follow mnemic laws, while physical phenomena follow physical laws, but in the realm of human activity, these two are inextricably linked. The sensation of a physical law (like gravity) creates a mnemic image that informs the psychological habit of caution, which is then codified into an institutional safety regulation. Every institutional structure is an attempt to harness the predictability of mnemic causality to manage the unpredictability of physical sensations. By understanding the causal flow from sensation to image, and from image to memory and belief, we gain a clearer picture of how individual psychological states are transformed into the massive, enduring structures of the social and legal world.

Ultimately, the study of these causal chains reveals a world where the past is never truly gone. It is preserved in the images we carry, the habits we exhibit, the language we speak, and the laws we obey. The causal structure of the mind is such that the past is a constant participant in the present, exerting its influence through a complex web of psychological and social mechanisms. There is no judgment to be made here about whether this is good or bad; it is simply the nature of the human condition. We are creatures of memory, governed by the ghosts of our sensations, and our entire social and institutional world is a reflection of that fundamental causal reality. The refinement of this system, from the primitive association of images to the global complexity of modern institutions, represents the ongoing evolution of our species as it navigates the tension between the immediate demands of the senses and the enduring influence of the past.

The investigation into the nature of the mind necessitates a rigorous deconstruction of the constituents of mental life, beginning with the fundamental distinction between the physical and the psychological. At the heart of this inquiry is a commitment to a form of neutral monism, an implicit ontological assumption that the world is not composed of two distinct substances—mind and matter—but rather of a single underlying collection of neutral events. These events are classified as "physical" when viewed through the lens of physics and its causal laws, and as "mental" when they are considered in relation to a single "biography" or nervous system. Within this framework, the concepts of sensations, images, the past, and memory serve as the essential building blocks for understanding how a subject interacts with the world and constructs a sense of history.

To understand these concepts, one must first identify the role of sensation. A sensation is defined not as a purely mental act directed toward an object, but as the actual intersection of the physical world and the perceiving organism. It is a neutral event that can be studied by both the physicist and the psychologist. For the physicist, the sensation is the final link in a chain of causal events starting from an external object, such as light reflecting off a surface and hitting the retina. For the psychologist, the sensation is the starting point of experience. It is crucial to distinguish sensation from perception. Perception is a complex state that includes not only the raw sensation but also a surrounding aura of expectations, memories, and habits. Sensation, in its purest form, is the unadorned data of the senses. It is constrained by the laws of physics; if the light is blocked, the sensation ceases. It does not possess the "mnemic" quality—the dependence on past experience—that characterizes more complex mental states.

From the bedrock of sensation, we move to the concept of the image. Images are described as "ghosts" of sensations. They are similar to sensations in their qualitative content—an image of a blue patch resembles a sensation of a blue patch—but they differ in their causal origins and their felt intensity. While a sensation is tied to a present external stimulus, an image is a "mnemic" phenomenon. It arises not because an object is currently affecting the sense organs, but because of the residue of past sensations. This introduces a fundamental conceptual distinction: the difference between physical causation and mnemic causation. Physical causation follows the laws of inertia and energy transfer, whereas mnemic causation allows the past to influence the present directly through the medium of the organism. Images are the primary vehicle of this mnemic influence.

The relationship between sensations and images is one of "prototype" and "copy." An image is essentially a representation of a sensation that occurred previously. However, images are not merely weaker sensations. They are qualified by a lack of the "vividness" and "externality" that sensations possess. A sensation has a certain "force" or "compulsion" that an image lacks. Furthermore, images belong exclusively to the realm of psychology and the "biography" of the individual. While two people can be said to see the same physical object (resulting in two similar sensations), the images that arise in their minds afterward are private and internal. They are the materials from which the internal life of the mind is constructed.

The transition from images to memory requires the introduction of several more complex conceptual layers. Memory is not a singular faculty, nor is it a simple storage of past sensations. It is a complex of present mental occurrences that refer to the past. Specifically, memory involves an image accompanied by a "feeling of belief" and a "feeling of pastness." This distinction is vital for conceptual precision. An image alone is not a memory; one can imagine a dragon without believing it ever existed. To remember a dog one saw yesterday, one must have an image of the dog, and that image must be accompanied by a specific attitude or "feeling" that points toward the past.

The "feeling of belief" is a central, though difficult, concept. It is a subjective state that attaches itself to an image, transforming it from a mere fancy into a claim about reality. In the context of memory, this belief is directed toward the "pastness" of the image. This "feeling of pastness" is an irreducible quality of certain images, a sense of "this happened." It is a flavor of the experience that distinguishes it from an image of a future possibility or a purely fictional construction. Without this feeling, the image would be untethered from time. It is the belief-feeling that provides the cognitive link between the current mental state and a previous event.

This leads to the conceptualization of "the past." In this framework, the past is not something that is directly perceived or "stored" in the mind like a book in a library. Instead, the past is a logical construction based on the present data of memory. We do not "see" the past; we see a present image and experience a present feeling of belief, and from these, we infer the existence of a prior event. This carries an important implicit assumption: that our memory-beliefs are generally accurate, even though they occur entirely in the present. This necessitates a distinction between the "objective" past—the actual events that occurred—and the "subjective" past—the structure of memories currently held by the individual. The concept of the past is thus mediated by the present image; we can only know the past insofar as it has left a mnemic trace that can be reactivated in the form of an image.

The relationship between memory and the past is further qualified by the distinction between "habit-memory" and "image-memory." Habit-memory is the ability to perform a task (like playing an instrument or speaking a language) due to past practice, without necessarily having a conscious image of the previous learning sessions. This is a purely mnemic causal effect where the past shapes present behavior. Image-memory, however, is the conscious recall of a specific event, requiring the presence of a mental image. Conceptual clarity requires that we do not conflate the two. A person might "remember" how to swim (habit) without "remembering" the specific day they learned (image-memory). Image-memory is the more complex psychological phenomenon because it involves the cognitive claim that a specific event occurred in the past.

To understand how these concepts relate, one must examine the role of "meaning" in images. An image is said to "mean" its prototype—the original sensation from which it was derived. This relationship of meaning is what allows memory to function as knowledge. If an image is a "copy" of a past sensation, then the belief-feeling attached to that image is a belief about the prototype. The accuracy of a memory depends on the degree of resemblance between the image and the prototype. However, images are often blurred or distorted versions of their prototypes. This suggests that memory is not a perfect reproduction but a reconstructive process. The "past" that we remember is a simplified and often schematic version of the "past" that was actually sensed.

Another necessary conceptual distinction is the "feeling of familiarity." This is often associated with memory but is distinct from the "feeling of pastness." Familiarity is a sense of recognition that occurs when a sensation is repeated. It does not necessarily involve a conscious image of the previous occurrence. For example, one might walk into a room and feel it is familiar without specifically remembering the last time one was there. Familiarity is a bridge between sensation and memory; it indicates that the current sensation is interacting with a mnemic trace. Memory proper arises when this familiarity is developed into a specific image accompanied by the belief that the image represents a unique, dated event in the individual’s history.

The constraints on memory and images are also significant. Images are constrained by the "mnemic laws of association." One image tends to call up another because the prototypes of those images were experienced together in the past. This associative structure is what gives the mind its continuity. Without these laws, our mental life would be a chaotic series of unrelated images. Sensations, by contrast, are constrained by physical laws. The relationship between the two is what allows for the possibility of empirical knowledge. We use our images (memories) to interpret our sensations (perceptions), allowing us to recognize objects and predict future events.

One must also consider the "subjectivity" of these mental constituents. Since images and the feelings of belief and pastness are internal to a single biography, they are fundamentally private. However, the theory attempts to ground them in a neutral reality by tying them back to sensations, which have a physical aspect. This creates a conceptual tension: the "past" is a shared reality that physics deals with, but "memory" is a private experience. The resolution lies in the idea that memory-images are physical events of a special kind—those that occur within a brain and are subject to mnemic causation.

The definition of "belief" in this context is also highly specific. It is not necessarily a conscious intellectual judgment or a linguistic proposition. It is often a "feeling" or a "motor-tendency"—a state of the organism that leads to certain actions based on the assumption that the image represents a past fact. This broadens the scope of memory to include non-linguistic animals, who may experience a "feeling of belief" and a "feeling of pastness" in a rudimentary, non-verbal form. By defining belief as a "feeling" rather than a logical operation, the framework allows for a more biological and psychological account of how organisms navigate time.

In summary, the conceptual architecture of this view of the mind is built upon a few precise distinctions. Sensations are the neutral, primary data, governed by physical laws. Images are mnemic copies of these sensations, governed by laws of association. Memory is a complex state involving a present image, a feeling of familiarity or pastness, and a feeling of belief. The past is a logical construction, an inference made from these present mental states to a previous reality.

The relationship between these terms is hierarchical and causal. Sensations are the prototypes for images; images are the content of memories; and memories are the evidence for the past. The "mnemic causation" that links them is the unique feature of the psychological realm, allowing the past to persist in the present through the medium of the image. This persistent influence of the past is what transforms a mere sequence of physical events into a psychological "biography."

To attain conceptual clarity, one must resist the urge to see "the mind" as a separate entity that "has" memories or "sees" images. Instead, the mind is the collection of these sensations, images, and feelings. The "subject" is not a mystical observer but a name for the way these events are grouped together according to the laws of mnemic causation. This requires a shift in how we understand "knowledge" of the past. Knowledge is not a direct grasp of a bygone moment, but a present alignment of an image and a belief that happens to correspond to a past sensation.

The precision of these definitions serves to strip away the metaphysical baggage often associated with consciousness. By defining memory as a complex of present feelings and images, the framework brings the study of the past into the realm of observable psychological phenomena. It acknowledges that while the past is gone, its effects remain in the structure of the organism, manifesting as the "mnemic" power to produce images and feelings of familiarity. The distinction between the image and the sensation remains the most important boundary, as it separates the world of physics (the sensation as a physical event) from the world of psychology (the image as a mnemic event).

Ultimately, the conceptual meaning of these terms hinges on their placement within a causal system. Sensations are defined by their physical causes, images by their mnemic causes, and memories by the specific subjective feelings that accompany images. The past is the temporal dimension projected by these mnemic processes. Together, they form a cohesive account of how a being composed of neutral events can come to have a sense of history, a continuity of self, and a body of knowledge about a world that is no longer present to the senses. Through the careful qualification of what is "given" in experience (sensations) and what is "added" by the mind (images and beliefs), we gain a clearer understanding of the complex relationship between the present moment and the history that shaped it.

This framework necessitates a rejection of the idea that the mind is a "mirror" of nature. Instead, the mind is a filter and a constructor. Sensations provide the raw material, but images and the feelings of belief organize that material into a coherent temporal narrative. The "pastness" we attribute to our memories is a quality of the present image, not a property of the past itself. This interpretive clarity allows us to see that our sense of the past is always a present mental construction, constrained by the accuracy of our images and the reliability of our mnemic processes. The study of the mind, then, becomes the study of these present constituents and the causal laws that govern their appearance and disappearance within the biographical stream.

By emphasizing the neutral status of sensations and the mnemic nature of images, the conceptual distinctions provided allow for a bridge between the objective world of physics and the subjective world of experience. The "past" is no longer a metaphysical mystery but a logical necessity derived from the present existence of memory-images. Sensations remain the anchor to the external world, while images provide the internal depth that allows for thought, reflection, and the recognition of time. This precision in defining the components of mental life provides the necessary foundation for understanding the complex interplay between the organism and the history it carries within itself.

The human experience is fundamentally rooted in the processing of sensations and the subsequent formation of mental images, which together construct the phenomena of memory and the perception of the past. When examined from a system-level perspective, these internal mental events do not exist in a vacuum but are continuously shaped, categorized, and constrained by institutional, legal, and social structures. To understand the individual as a locus of sensations and images is to understand how broader organizational frameworks manage the flow of information and the interpretation of experience. This interaction defines not only the limits of individual behavior but also the very character of the person within the social architecture.

Sensations represent the primary interface between the individual and the external world. They are the raw data of existence, yet their interpretation is rarely a purely private affair. From an institutional perspective, sensations are standardized and categorized to ensure systemic efficiency. In the realm of public health and medicine, for example, the subjective experience of pain or sensory discomfort is translated into a diagnostic language that allows the institution to act. Here, the individual’s sensation is converted into a data point within a legal and medical framework. This conversion constrains behavior by providing a specific set of pathways for the individual to follow once a sensation is identified. A sensation that does not fit into an institutional category often lacks a social or legal standing, thereby shaping how the individual acknowledges or dismisses their own sensory input. This demonstrates an interaction where the institutional level dictates the validity of the individual’s raw experience.

As sensations fade, they leave behind images—mental echoes that persist after the physical stimulus has vanished. These images are the building blocks of thought and the medium through which the past is reconstructed. However, the palette of images available to an individual is largely a product of social and institutional environments. The architectural design of cities, the visual language of mass media, and the curricula of educational institutions provide the primary source material for these internal images. A person’s mental landscape is populated by images that reflect the social structures they inhabit. These images serve as internal templates that guide behavior. For instance, an individual’s image of "authority" or "order" is not an innate mental construct but a reflection of the institutional symbols they have encountered, such as uniforms, courtrooms, or corporate boardrooms. These images act as internal regulators, shaping character by aligning individual imagination with social reality.

The transition from images to memory involves the addition of a specific "feeling of pastness" and a belief in the continuity of the self. Memory is not merely a psychological faculty but a vital component of legal and social systems. The legal structure, in particular, is predicated on the reliability and linearity of memory. Contracts, testimonies, and the assignment of criminal responsibility depend on the individual’s ability to maintain a coherent narrative of their past actions. This institutional requirement for a stable memory forces a specific organization of the individual’s internal life. To be a "person" in the eyes of the law is to be an entity capable of recalling and accounting for past sensations and images in a manner that satisfies evidentiary standards. Consequently, the legal system constrains individual behavior by imposing a duty of remembrance; the individual must curate their memories to ensure they remain a consistent and responsible subject within the system.

Furthermore, social structures play a decisive role in the validation of memory. Collective memory, maintained through rituals, holidays, and shared histories, provides a framework within which individual memories are situated. When an individual’s memory of an event aligns with the social narrative, it is reinforced; when it diverges, it is often marginalized or pathologized. This social pressure ensures a degree of cognitive uniformity across the population. The interaction here is bidirectional: while individuals contribute their experiences to the social pool, the social structure filters these memories to maintain its own continuity. This filtering process shapes individual character by rewarding the retention of socially useful memories and discouraging the cultivation of images that might disrupt social cohesion.

The past, as a concept, is the aggregate of these memories and images, but it also functions as an institutional infrastructure. The past is documented in archives, databases, and legal precedents. These external repositories of the past exert a powerful influence on the present. For the individual, the past is not just something they remember; it is something they are held accountable for by institutions. Credit scores, criminal records, and educational transcripts are institutionalized versions of an individual’s past sensations and behaviors. These structures ensure that the past remains perpetually present, constraining future possibilities and shaping the individual’s trajectory. The individual is thus seen as a product of their history, where "character" is defined by the institutional record rather than the subjective flow of internal images.

The interaction between these levels of organization—the individual’s sensory life, social norms, and institutional mandates—creates a feedback loop that determines behavior. For example, the institutional demand for productivity shapes the sensory environment of the workplace, which in turn influences the images an individual carries home. These images inform the individual’s memory of their day and their anticipation of the future. Over time, this cycle hardens into character. A person characterized by punctuality and deference to hierarchy is not simply manifesting an internal trait; they are reflecting a set of ingrained responses to a sensory and social environment that prizes those specific qualities. The character is the residue of the system’s influence on the individual’s mental processes.

Legal structures also define the boundaries of the "image" and its relationship to intent. In many legal systems, the mental image of a future act (intent) is as crucial as the act itself. This forces the individual to engage in a form of internal surveillance, where they must monitor their own thoughts and images to ensure they do not cross into the realm of the illicit. The institutional gaze thus penetrates the internal life of the individual, shaping the very nature of their reflections. The privacy of the mind is, in this sense, a managed space where the individual’s internal images are expected to conform to the overarching legal and social codes.

Socialization is the process by which these institutional and social requirements are internalized. Through language, individuals learn to label their sensations and organize their images in ways that are communicable and socially acceptable. Language itself is a system-level structure that provides the categories for individual thought. Without the social gift of language, the individual’s sensations would remain a chaotic flux. By providing names for things, society allows the individual to stabilize their sensations into enduring images. This categorization is not neutral; it carries with it the values and priorities of the social structure. To learn a language is to learn a specific way of perceiving the past and imagining the future, thereby aligning the individual’ Efficiency with the needs of the collective.

The constraint on behavior is also visible in how institutions manage the "failures" of memory and sensation. When an individual’s sensory processing or memory retrieval deviates from the norm, they are often brought under the purview of psychological or correctional institutions. These institutions aim to recalibrate the individual’s mental life to bring it back into alignment with social expectations. Whether through therapy, medication, or retraining, the goal is to ensure that the individual’s internal world of images and sensations is functional within the broader system. This highlights the fact that the "mind," from a system-level perspective, is not an autonomous realm but a component of a larger social machine that requires a certain level of predictability and standardization.

The concept of the past also serves as a mechanism for social stratification. Institutional structures often prioritize certain types of pasts over others. For instance, the professional past of an individual (their resume) is given high institutional value, while their personal sensory history is largely ignored. This creates a hierarchy of images and memories where the individual is encouraged to prioritize those aspects of their history that have exchange value within the social and economic system. This prioritization shapes character by incentivizing the individual to focus their mental energy on institutional achievement, thereby molding their internal life to suit the requirements of the labor market and social status.

Interactions between the individual and the institutional levels are also mediated by technology, which serves as an externalization of memory and sensation. Digital archives, social media, and surveillance systems act as a secondary sensory apparatus and a permanent memory store. These technological structures ensure that an individual’s images and past are no longer confined to their brain but are distributed across a network. This distribution changes the nature of the individual’s relationship with their own past. When the past is perpetually accessible and visible to others, the individual’s behavior is constrained by the knowledge that their sensations and images can be reconstructed and evaluated by institutions at any time. The "character" of the individual becomes a public and permanent data set, further reducing the distinction between the private mind and the social system.

In this context, the individual is a nexus where biological sensations and images meet social and legal requirements. The character of the person is the habitual way in which they navigate these demands. If the social structure prizes innovation, the individual is encouraged to cultivate a specific set of images and to recall past successes in a way that fosters "creative" behavior. If the structure prizes stability and tradition, the individual’s memory is directed toward the preservation of historical images and the avoidance of sensory novelty. In both cases, the individual’s internal life is an echo of the systemic environment.

The legal system’s reliance on the "reasonable person" standard is perhaps the clearest example of how institutional structures shape individual character. This standard is an abstraction—a set of expected sensory reactions and memories that the law uses to judge the behavior of actual individuals. To be deemed "reasonable," an individual must demonstrate that their sensations, images, and memories align with a socially agreed-upon norm. This standard exerts a constant pressure on individuals to regulate their internal and external behavior to match this institutional ideal. The "reasonable person" is not a biological reality but a systemic requirement that shapes how individuals perceive their own experiences.

Even the experience of time is subject to systemic organization. The division of the past into eras, years, and work cycles is an institutional imposition on the fluid nature of memory. By forcing the individual to organize their memories according to a standardized calendar, the social structure ensures that the past is a shared and manageable resource. This temporal organization constrains behavior by creating a collective rhythm to which all individuals must adhere. The internal feeling of the passage of time is thus synchronized with the external clock of the institution, ensuring that individual sensations and memories remain useful for social coordination.

The systemic perspective also reveals that what we call "knowledge" is the institutionalization of sensations and images. Knowledge is sensation that has been verified, images that have been systematized, and memories that have been recorded. Educational institutions are the primary sites where this transformation occurs. By teaching individuals how to process their sensations and which images to value, these institutions ensure that the "mind" of the individual is a compatible part of the social whole. The character of the educated person is one whose internal mental events have been disciplined to follow certain logical and social patterns.

This alignment between the individual and the system is not necessarily the result of overt coercion but is often the product of the very nature of human cognition. Because images and memories are the only way we can represent the world to ourselves, and because the source material for those images is the social world, our internal life is inevitably a reflection of our external environment. The social and institutional structures provide the grammar of our mental life. We think in the images they provide, we remember in the categories they create, and we react to the sensations they prioritize.

The interaction between levels of organization also means that changes at the institutional level slowly reshape the individual’s internal world. For example, a shift in legal standards regarding privacy or property will eventually alter how individuals perceive their own images and memories. If certain memories are no longer legally protected, the individual’s internal relationship with those memories will change. They may become more guarded or more indifferent, illustrating how the legal structure reaches down into the very texture of individual consciousness.

Ultimately, the individual, when viewed through the lens of sensations, images, and memory, appears as a highly integrated node within a vast systemic network. Institutional, legal, and social structures do not merely surround the individual; they inhabit them. They provide the framework through which sensations are understood, the images that populate the imagination, and the standards by which the past is remembered. Individual behavior and character are the visible manifestations of this profound integration. The mind is not a fortress but a crossroads where the private experience of a sensation meets the public requirement of the system. In this light, the study of the mind becomes a study of the structures that define the human condition, showing how the most intimate aspects of our existence are inextricably linked to the broader organizational systems of society. This perspective emphasizes the continuity between the individual and the collective, where the internal and external are seen as parts of a single, complex, and self-regulating system.
